We will be using Flipgrid for this exercise. It's a great way for all of us to get to know each other and does not require you to download an app or create an account.

To post an entry, you just need to login with your "student username" and hit record! If you need help, you can [check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTBLq-WUC88).

If you can't see the FlipGrid, go directly to the website (https://flipgrid.com/---CODE---) or download the app. Our "Flip Code" is **---CODE---**.

The assignment is to post a short video where you tell us how to pronounce your name, something awesome about yourself, and where you live. You don't have to share a video if you don't want to (you can just do audio, you can record your screen, or you can upload an image).

Note that the "Student username" in this exercise is actually your first name mashed with your last name. So for me, Dave Ghidiu, I would use '**daveghidiu**'. If you have any issues with this, email me at dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu and I'll help you out!
