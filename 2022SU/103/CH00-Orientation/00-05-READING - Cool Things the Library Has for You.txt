^^ READING - Cool Things the Library Has for You

There are a few that might help as you prepare to do some light research at FLCC:

* **[Ask a Librarian](https://library.flcc.edu/ask.cfm)** - Call, email, or chat with a librarian. They can answer any questions you have and will even work with you to help you research.

* **[Research Tutorial](https://libguides.flcc.edu/c.php?g=536230)** - You can experience the entire tutorial, but for the assignment we are doing in class, Modules 3, 4, and 7 are the most relevant. They cover how to search and how to cite your work. You don't have to go through the tutorial, but it's helpful if you don't really know where to start.

* **[WFH Related Tools](https://libguides.flcc.edu/specialcircumstances)** - When COVID hit in March 2020, the Library put together some really neat resources. You might want to poke around in there (especially the pieces on tips for working from home and de-stressing.

* **[Computer Science Research Guide](https://libguides.flcc.edu/computer_science)** - This guide was custom made for the research assignment in this class! Dig around in here for more specifics on tackling the assignment.
