^^ WEEK 4 - Midweek Check In

# New chapter
Computational Thinking is the most recent chapter. It's quite unlike a lot of the stuff you may have experienced in the past. Computational Thinking is a way of looking at problems and developing solutions (specifically the processes needed to solve the problem).

# Grades
I wanted to have everything graded by Monday, but I couldn't ðŸ˜”. I'll have it all done by Saturday morning *at the absolute latest*. Thanks for your patience!
