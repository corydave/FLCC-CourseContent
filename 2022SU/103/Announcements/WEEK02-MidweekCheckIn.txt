^^ WEEK 02 - Midweek Check In

# Hiya!
Just a reminder folks that because of the rough start with Brightspace and Blackboard, anything that *was* due on June 7 isn't officially due until June 14. Also, the two week grace period for work *does not apply* to the FlipGrid experience - please make sure you do that by June 14!

I've heard from a few students so far, and it's been great! If you have time, please email me so we can set up a time to chat. I'd love to get to know you!

If you need anything, lemme know!
