^^ WEEK 4 - Midweek Check In, The Sequel

# Grades are done... for now
I've graded all the work that was due (up until the most recent chapter). I should have specified yesterday that I intended to grade all the work that was due up until the most recent chapter - I'll finish the rest of the work in the next few days. A few things:

* For the most part, GREAT WORK!
* I left some feedback for almost every single assignment - please make sure you look at it (go into the gradebook and click on the chat bubble next to the assignment).
* In most cases, if there was an issue I let you know and let you know if you can resubmit it.
   * If you decide to resubmit, please remember that you have to access the assignment NOT through the gradebook; you have to go through COURSE CONTENT and click through all the folders.

# ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL WEATHER!
It's sunny out!!!!
