^^ WEEK 3 - Midweek Check In

# Weekend!
Hey folks! I've started grading the work that has been submitted and expect to have all of it done by Monday!!!! Don't forget that if you have been struggling with some of the content in this course, it gets better. The mathy parts and the techy nerdy parts are right at the beginning of the course. Just wait until we get to game design and web design - those are some of my favorite parts of this class!

I hope all is going well and if you have any questions, please let me know. I will be in and out of internet access for the next two days ðŸ™‚.
