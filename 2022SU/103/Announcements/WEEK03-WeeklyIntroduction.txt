^^ WEEK 3 - Weekly Introduction

# Welcome to Chapter 2!
Hey folks! This week we'll be looking at Hardware and Operating Systems. A few things you'll need to know:

* This chapter looks at hardware and operating systems. If you are in the Networking & Cybersecurity program, this chapter is a precursor to what you'll see in CSC-271.

* You'll need a Google account (Gmail, Google Docs, YouTube) to do the Windows and Linux walkthrough assignments.

* I'll be grading the work that has been submitted in the next 2-3 days.
