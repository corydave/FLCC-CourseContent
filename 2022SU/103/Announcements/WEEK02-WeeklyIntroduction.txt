^^ WEEK 02 - Weekly Introduction

Hey folks! Welcome to the second week of Computing Sciences Portal class!

I *think* I've gotten a handle on updating all the due dates in Mimir and Blackboard, but if I missed any, let me know please!

I've updated the Course Content with Chapter 1. It's taking me a bit longer than I thought to add the rest of the content for the course, but I'm getting there! Thank you for your patience as I recover from the abrupt change to Blackboard.

A few things to know for this week:

* There are two different folders in Chapter 1 - "Introduction" and "Number Systems". Both folders have content due next week.

* I've changed the due dates in this class from Tuesdays to Wednesdays. There are a lot of people enrolled in both this class and Java, and I think having the due dates on different days might help.

* That means that if you haven't done the FlipGrid that was due today, you get an extra day! It's due by noon tomorrow (Wednesday) - and remember that this is one of the few assignments that can't be submitted late.

* In the "Introduction" folder, there is an *Infographic* assignment - have fun with it! For the *Technical Writing* assignment, try to be as specific as you can. You should look at the rubrics for both assignments [here's a video on how to do that](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/teLiVab8Dok).

* In the "Number Systems" folder, there is an assignment where you have to change numbers to different bases. Don't panic if it's too much math for you! This is *by far* the most math we'll do all semester.
