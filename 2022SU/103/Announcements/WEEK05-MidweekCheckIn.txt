^^ WEEK 5 - Midweek Check In

# Midweek Check In

Hiya!

I hope the chapter is going well - I haven't had any emails so I hope that everything is going well. If you haven't watched the Network Chuck videos, make sure you do. You won't regret it!

Don't forget that the Messy Problems are due soon, too! There is a good chance you will need to ask me questions, so make sure you plan accordingly! I will be driving all day Tuesday, so please be patient with my response time.
