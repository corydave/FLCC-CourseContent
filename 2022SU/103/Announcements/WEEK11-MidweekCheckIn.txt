^^ WEEK 11 - Midweek Check In

# Final Push
Hey folks - just a reminder that Tuesday, August 16, is *the absolute last day any work can be accepted*. Please plan on having all work submitted by noon (12:00 pm) on that day.

The final project, your portfolio, is due that day as well. Be sure you've read comments I left on the assignment where you submitted the framework (in the Web Design chapter) so you can be confident that the organization is correct.

If you have any questions, email me!
