^^ VIDEO - IDEs, Java, and HelloWorld Walkthrough

# Description

This video is from last summer and shows me using the Mimir IDE to do the coding - I'd recommend getting your own IDE (some people like Eclipse, some people like IntelliJ, some people like JGrasp). I personally *LOVE* [Google Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/). It's cloud based, it has great features, and it works every single time.
