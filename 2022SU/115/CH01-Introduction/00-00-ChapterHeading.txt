^^ CHAPTER 01 - Introduction

# Experiences for this chapter

This chapter is an examination of the tools you need to get started programming. We'll look at the Mimir IDE (integrated development environment), some basic output, and the typical flow of the course.

Be sure to read Chapter 1 of the textbook and watch the video about IDEs (we used to use Mimir as an IDE, but I think Google Cloud Shell is just as good).
