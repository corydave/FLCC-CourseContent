^^ CHAPTER 2 - Basic Java && Variables
<br />&#9660;

</CENTER>


</div>

<div id="ch02Contents" style="display:none;">

# What to expect

There are a few different things going on in this chapter. We'll look at the different types of comments, we'll check out some different types of *variables* (like the difference between integers, decimals, and words), ways to use *variables*, different ways to output information, and the types of errors that you are likely to encounter.

If you feel like you're getting Java and you don't need a review of the chapter, you can skip some of the videos. But *please* watch the **FeetToMiles** video because it not only helps contextualize one of the labs you'll be doing, but there is *a lot* of collateral learning in it (things like shortcuts for commenting, ways to use the command line in Linux, and other cool things).

# To ponder

In the meantime, ponder what you think this code might do:


```java

int total = 187;
int numOfAssignments = 2;

System.out.println("The average is " + (total/numOfAssignments) + ".");

```
