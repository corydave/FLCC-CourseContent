# Experiences for this chapter

Not gonna lie - this chapter is a lot of work. As you have been building up your Java experience, you may have been asking yourself, "Self, what's next? I mean, aren't I doing things that every other developer who was learning already did?"

And the answer is, "YES". But the good news is that Java has an API (Application Programmer Interface) which is basically a list of *tons* of pre-made mini-programs that you can use! Actually, there are roughly 4,300 of them. We'll only use a select few of them.

One of the other cool things about the Java API is that each mini-program comes with an instruction booklet of sorts!

<br />

***This. Chapter. Has. A LOT. Of. Work!!!***

<br />

Be sure to read Chapter 4 of the textbook and watch the video playlist (maybe 5 videos) if you have questions!

# To ponder

In the meantime, ponder what you think this code might do:


```java

Random rand = new Random();
System.out.println(rand.nextInt());

```

<script>
function ch04ContentsToggle() {
  var content = document.getElementById("ch04Contents");
  if (content.style.display === "none") {
    content.style.display = "inline-block";
  } else {
    content.style.display = "none";
  }
}
</script>
