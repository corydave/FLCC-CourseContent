The reading for this chapter is [Chapter 4 - Standard Java Classes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-FmWZFelbIoXxZuQifn5Xv1CceJwMijJnf7A3rjghOI/edit). There is an entire library of pre-written software you can (and should!) use when programming in Java. This chapter goes into detail about several of those "classes" (that's what we call the mini-programs). In the Java API, there are roughly 4,300 classes. We will rely on maybe 6 for the entire semester.

As you are reading, please make sure you leave comments in the margins (you can highlight text in the document and leave a comment). Perhaps you notice a typo. Maybe you have something to add. Or maybe you just want to add a question that someone else can answer for you.
