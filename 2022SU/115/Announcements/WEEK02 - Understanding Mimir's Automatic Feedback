^^ WEEK 2 - Understanding Mimir's Automatic Feedback

# Automatic Feedback in Mimir
Hey folks - as the second week of Java is coming to a close, I've been fielding a few questions from students working on the labs. The video below is a good example of submitting a lab (the Triangle Area lab), failing it, revising, failing, and revising again until it passes. The whole video is 7 and a half minutes and I believe it might help you in two ways:

1. Understand how to learn from the automatic feedback in Mimir (and how to use the tools in Mimir's feedback to help inform your next iteration).

2. Understand what the biggest common problem is in the Triangle Area lab.
