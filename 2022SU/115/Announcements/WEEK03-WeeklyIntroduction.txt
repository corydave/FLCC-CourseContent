^^ WEEK 03 - Weekly Introduction

# Welcome to week 3!

A few things, folks:

* Work was due today at noon; if you need to use your late days, go for it! Mimir has those built in (if you need help figuring out how to use them, let me know).

* Chapters 3 and 4 have been deployed in Blackboard and in Mimir. Chapter 3 is a quick read and there are only two small assignments for the chapter. But Chapter 4 is *huge*. It covers *a lot of information*. If you wait until next week to start Chapter 4, you will most likely run out of time. I cannot stress this enough - treat Chapter 4 as a two-week unit. Go through Chapter 3 fast and then plan on dedicating at least a week and a half (or two full weeks) to Chapter 4. If you have questions, please let me know.

* Some of you may have received emails from Mimir saying your work was late. I'm not sure what caused it, but if your work was handed in on time, you're all set :)
