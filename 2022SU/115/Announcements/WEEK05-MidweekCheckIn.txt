^^ WEEK 5 - Midweek Check In

# Midweek Check In

Hiya!

It looks like things are going well this week - I haven't had many questions in my email. That's great news! I hope this chapter is going well; the `if-else` statements are pretty intuitive (I hope!).

A few of you reached out and let me know that the link for the Chapter 5 reading was wrong. I've fixed it! Thank you for letting me know!
