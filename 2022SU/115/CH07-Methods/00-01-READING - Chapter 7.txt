The reading for this chapter is [Chapter 7 - Methods](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ue2JWKXg1Mwzx6WpDmctmd3t-_MUDK7RccCtZE0AkDk/edit). 

We'll be looking at *methods* in this chapter. We've really been using methods since we started (you know - every time we call a mini-program from the `main` method? Or a call to a scanner (like `sc.nextLine()`). Now we'll be going a bit deeper into different types of methods.

As you are reading, please make sure you leave comments in the margins (you can highlight text in the document and leave a comment). Perhaps you notice a typo. Maybe you have something to add. Or maybe you just want to add a question that someone else can answer for you.
