^^ FINAL GRADES ARE POSTED

# Congratulations! ðŸ¥³

You did it! The semester is over! Thank you ALL so much for making it the best semester I've had in 19 years of teaching.

Seriously. That's not lip service.


# Final grades are posted

Everything is graded! I like to have a few days built in so that you can review your grades and lemme know if you think there is an error.

If you think there is a problem, email me at dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu and state what you think the issue is. I'm happy to work with you and figure out how to optimize your grade. All grades are final as of Sunday, December 19, so if you have an issue please contact me by Sunday at noon.
