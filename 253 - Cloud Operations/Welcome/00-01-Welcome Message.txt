^^ Welcome Message

Hello and welcome to CSC 253! My name is Dave Ghidiu and I'm your instructor for this course, Cloud Operations. I'm so looking forward to getting to know you better and learning about the cloud together - although most of us have worked together already ðŸ˜€. This course will serve as an introduction to cloud operations - specifically through the lens of Amazon Web Services.

There is no textbook that you need to buy for this class! ***ALL*** of this class will be in the Amazon environment.

Take a look at the syllabus below to get an understanding of this course. You can *totally* email (dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu) me if you have any questions!

I'm looking forward to learning with you this semester!
