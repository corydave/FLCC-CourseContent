^^ AWS - Course Welcome and Overview

While all the content is important, you should certainly make sure you go through the activities. All work is done [in the AWS learning platform](https://awsacademy.instructure.com/) (with the exception of labs - those are completed in the AWS platform but the evidence is submitted in Brightspace). We don't have any labs in this chapter; we'll only be looking at how the platform that Amazon uses works.
