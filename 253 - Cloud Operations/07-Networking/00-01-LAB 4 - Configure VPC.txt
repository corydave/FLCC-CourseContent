* Configure route tables that are associated with a public subnet for internet-bound traffic to be directed to the internet gateway for direct internet access.
* Configure route tables that are associated with a private subnet for isolated resources to securely connect to the internet through a NAT gateway.
* Launch a bastion host in a public subnet for resourcebased secured access to the private subnet.
* Evaluate the operation of the private subnet's ability to communicate with the internet.
