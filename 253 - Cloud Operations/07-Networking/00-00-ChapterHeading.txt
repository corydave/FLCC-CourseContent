In this chapter, we'll fall in love with *virtual private clouds*! This includes the layered defense model.

While all the content is important, you should certainly make sure you go through the activities. All work is done [in the AWS learning platform](https://awsacademy.instructure.com/) (with the exception of labs - those are completed in the AWS platform but the evidence is submitted in Brightspace).
