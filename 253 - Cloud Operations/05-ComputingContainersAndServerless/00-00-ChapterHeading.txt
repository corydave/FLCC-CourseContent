In this chapter, we'll look at *AWS Lambda* (executing code without provisioning a server), APIs, and *containers*.

While all the content is important, you should certainly make sure you go through the activities. All work is done [in the AWS learning platform](https://awsacademy.instructure.com/) (with the exception of labs - those are completed in the AWS platform but the evidence is submitted in Brightspace).
