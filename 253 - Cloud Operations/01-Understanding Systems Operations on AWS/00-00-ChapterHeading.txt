In this chapter, we'll look at the very basics of getting started with AWS operations - including an activity where we will install and configure the AWS command line interface. Get used to using the command line! While all the content is important, you should certainly make sure you go through the activities. All work is done [in the AWS learning platform](https://awsacademy.instructure.com/) (with the exception of labs - those are completed in the AWS platform but the evidence is submitted in Brightspace).
