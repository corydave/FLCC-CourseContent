In this chapter, we'll dig deeper into Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

While all the content is important, you should certainly make sure you go through the activities. All work is done [in the AWS learning platform](https://awsacademy.instructure.com/) (with the exception of labs - those are completed in the AWS platform but the evidence is submitted in Brightspace).
