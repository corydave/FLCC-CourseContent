^^ Final Project

Congratulations! You've made it to the end of the course! For the final project, you can choose from one of these options (or pitch your own - email me at dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu).

Note that *you can use AI to any extent that you want*. This means that you could use AI to create a fictional poorly architected AWS environment and then you create a remediation plan. Or you could have AI create the plan. Or you could use AI to make a sick website showcasing some of the concepts from this course. Or you could use AI to do something else. But... there are two stipulations to using AI:

1. You *must* be very clear how you used AI
2. You *must* check your work (and format it) before submitting. 

It is fine to use AI for all of your work, but you need to vet that work and declare the AI you used. 

# "Real Problem" Projects

* Design a disaster recovery strategy for a specific scenario (startup that just got funded, legacy business migrating cloud, nonprofit with tight budget). Have them justify their choices.

* Audit a (fictional or real) poorly-architected AWS environment and create a remediation plan. What would they fix first? Why?

* Build a cost optimization proposal for a company burning money in the cloud. Use AWS Cost Explorer data or simulated data.

# Deep Dives

* Become an expert on one service and create a resource (guide, decision tree, interactive tool) helping others know when/how/why to use it. Their choice of service reveals what they think matters.

* Investigate a real cloud incident (AWS has case studies) and create a post-mortem analysis with prevention strategies.

* Compare how different companies or industries approach a single CloudOps challenge (e.g., compliance, monitoring, disaster recovery).

# Creative/Experiential

* Create a "choose your own adventure" scenario using AI where learners make decisions and see consequences (deployment fails, costs spike, security breach, etc.).

* Build a visual guide or interactive tool explaining a complex concept (VPC networking, IAM permission models, CloudFormation workflows).

* Interview a real cloud ops engineer or architect and synthesize lessons learned into actionable guidance.

# Provocative/Reflective

* "What's missing from this course?" – identify a gap in CloudOps they think matters and develop materials/guidance around it.

* Design the onboarding training for a new CloudOps engineer at a specific company type. What do they need to know?

* Predict: what will cloud operations look like in 3-5 years? What skills matter now vs. then?

You may submit your work any way you'd like.
