^^ PROJECT - `approve_deny_list`

## DESCRIPTION
This lab is intended to explore file writing capabilities with Python. In this lab, there are four files on the server - 
* `approve.txt` contains a list of URLs that are safe for the organization
* `deny.txt` contains a list of URLs that are not permitted by the organization
* `review.txt` starts empty but any URL that is considered and is not on either the "approve list" or the "deny list" should be added.
* `log.txt` should include *every* URL as well as the status.

Your job is to:
1. Ask the user for a URL
2. See if the URL is in the `approve.txt` list or the `deny.txt` list
3. Log the request, indicating STATUS of either `approve`, `deny`, or `review` (if the IP address is not on either list)
4. Add the URL to `review.txt` if it is not in `approve.txt` or `deny.txt`

### Adding a time stamp

To add a time stamp, you'll need to use the `datetime` module. Make sure you do two things:

1. `import datetime` at the beginning of your code
2. Generate a timestamp using this code:

<center>

`timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")`

</center>
