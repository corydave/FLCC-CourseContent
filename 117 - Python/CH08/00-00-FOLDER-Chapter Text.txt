Designing programs (in any language) is perhaps one of the most important (and overlooked) skills in software engineering. You want your code to be poetic. You don't want your code to repeat itself. You want your code to be elegant. You don't want your code to be overly-complex. You want to have wonderful documentation. 

There is a lot to think about when designing software - and oftentimes the first step is to chart things out in a flowchart or pseudocode before sitting down to code.
