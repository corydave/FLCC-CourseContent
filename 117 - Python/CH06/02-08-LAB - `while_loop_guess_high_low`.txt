^^ LAB - `while_loop_guess_high_low`

## DESCRIPTION
Building on `while_loop_guess_high_low`, we will add a feature - we'll tell the user if their guess is too high or too low. This means we'll have to introduce logic (probably an `if-else` statement. 

The "secret number" in this exercise is (again) 33 (and is hard-coded into the software as a constant).

## SPECIFICATIONS
