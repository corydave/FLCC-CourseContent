^^ Loops

Loops are a way to repeat lines of code over and over and over and over...

There are two basic loops we use in Python - the `for` loop (which is usually used when we need to execute code a determined number of times) and a `while` loop (when we need to execute code until a condition happens).

Check this out:

```python
word = 'Finger Lakes'

for x in word:
  print(x)
```

In the example above, we are using `x` as the variable to hold each character in `'Finger Lakes'` as we *iterate* through the word.

The output is:

```

F
i
n
g
e
r
 
L
a
k
e
s
````

See what happened there? We gave the `for` loop a variable, `x`, that would temporarily hold each of the items as it went through the string, `'Finger Lakes'`.

We can actually give a `for` loop a range, too:

```python
for x in range(10, 20):
    print(x)
```

```

10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
```

Note that the last number to be printed was `19`, not `20`. Which is odd because in the example with the string, each character was output. That is just because Python treats strings and *ranges* a bit differently.

There are a few different tricks we'll look at with `print()` in this chapter as well.

There are a few different videos in this chapter and then a number of labs. The labs ramp up based on complexity so be sure to do them in order! Also, this chapter is two weeks long because *there are a lot of exercises*. Have faith in the system! The labs are pretty short and they each lead into the next.

# Prediction
What do you think the output will be when this code is executed?

```python

for x in range(0, 15, 2):
    print(x)

```
