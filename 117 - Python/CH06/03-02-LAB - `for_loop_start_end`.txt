^^ LAB - `for_loop_start_end`

## DESCRIPTION
Building on `for_loop_range` and using what we covered in the `for loops` video, we will go one step further and ask the user to pick a starting point and ending point and then display all the numbers, *inclusively* on one line.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the Sample Output *exactly*.

* Be sure to watch both the **[More Print](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_R3xZTWfuo)** and **[For Loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usC1VA5lzDw)** videos first.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT


```
Starting point: 3
Ending point: 7
3 4 5 6 7
```
<br />

```
Starting point: -4
Ending point: 4
-4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4
```

<br />

```
Starting point: 0
Ending point: 1
0 1
```

<br />
