^^ LAB - `authenticate`

## DESCRIPTION
This lab is probably the purest example of `while` loops. In this exercise, the user keeps typing in a password until they get it right.

Obviously, this is insecure (because systems should not allow for unlimited password attempts, passwords should be stored as hashes, and passwords should not appear as cleartext when typed in), but this is just an academic exercise.

The password is `tooManySecrets` and is hard-coded as a constant.

## SPECIFICATIONS
