# FILE NAME: lucky_number_generator.py
# AUTHOR: Dave Ghidiu
# DATE: 2024-03-056
# DESCRIPTION: A lucky number, 1-50, is provided to the user. They can keep generating more lucky numbers until they want to quit.


import random

def main():
    lucky_number_generator()

def lucky_number_generator():

    # Welcome the user
    print('Welcome to the Lucky Number Generator!')

    # Create the variable to capture the user's choice - let's
    # call it `choice`. Let's also give it an initial value 
    # of 'y'
    choice = 'y'

    # Create a loop that repeats as long as `choice` equals 'y'
    while choice.lower() == 'y':

        # Output a random number between 1 and 50
        print(random.randint(1, 50))

        # Give the user a choice to play again
        choice = input('Would you like a lucky number (y/n)? ')

    # At this point, the loop is over, so code below
    # here will *always* execute. Let's thank the 
    # user for playing!
    print('\nThank you for playing.')
    

main()
