^^ FUNSIES - `port_knocking_simulation`

## DESCRIPTION
In cybersecurity, "port knocking" is a technique where a firewall only grants access after detecting a specific sequence of connection attempts on various ports - similar to a secret knock on a door. This lab will help you understand loop-based validation and sequence checking, which are fundamental cybersecurity concepts.

You may find it easier to use a *nested loop* - that is when one loop lives inside another. Let's say that the inside loop iterates 4 times and the outside (containing) loop iterates 3 times. That means we have 12 iterations! Here's a simple example:

```python

for i in range(3):  # Outer loop: iterates 3 times (0, 1, 2)
    for j in range(4):  # Inner loop: iterates 4 times (0, 1, 2, 3) for each outer loop iteration of the containing loop
        print(f'Outer: {i}, Inner: {j}, Product: {i * j}')

```

The output is:

```
Outer: 0, Inner: 0, Product: 0
Outer: 0, Inner: 1, Product: 0
Outer: 0, Inner: 2, Product: 0
Outer: 0, Inner: 3, Product: 0
Outer: 1, Inner: 0, Product: 0
Outer: 1, Inner: 1, Product: 1
Outer: 1, Inner: 2, Product: 2
Outer: 1, Inner: 3, Product: 3
Outer: 2, Inner: 0, Product: 0
Outer: 2, Inner: 1, Product: 2
Outer: 2, Inner: 2, Product: 4
Outer: 2, Inner: 3, Product: 6
```

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
===== PORT KNOCKING FIREWALL SIMULATOR =====
This firewall requires a specific sequence of port connections.
You have 3 attempts to find the correct sequence.
(Hint: Enter ports as integers, one at a time)

Attempt 1 of 3:
Enter your port knock sequence. Enter 0 when finished.
Enter port number: 3
Enter port number: 4
Enter port number: 5
Enter port number: 0

FIREWALL RESPONSE: Connection rejected!
Your sequence had 3 knocks, but the firewall expects 4.

Attempt 2 of 3:
Enter your port knock sequence. Enter 0 when finished.
Enter port number: 2222
Enter port number: 3333
Enter port number: 4444
Enter port number: 5555
Enter port number: 0

FIREWALL RESPONSE: Connection accepted!
Correct port knocking sequence detected.
Firewall has opened port 22 for your connection.
```

MAXIMUM ATTEMPTS REACHED
Firewall has blocked your IP address for 30 minutes.
The correct sequence was: [2222, 3333, 4444, 5555]
