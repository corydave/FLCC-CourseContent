^^ LAB - `while_loop_count`

## DESCRIPTION
By now you've had experience with `for` loops (we primarily use those for times when code needs to be repeated a pre-defined number of times). 

This lab is the first foray into `while` loops - loops that iterate until a condition happens. And while that is *mostly* true, the `while` loop in this lab actually runs a pre-defined number of times.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the Sample Output *exactly*.

## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. You will need to change the comments (for instance, your name and the date).
