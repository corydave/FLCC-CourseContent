^^ LAB - `while_loop_count_nice`

## DESCRIPTION
In this, our second exploration into `while` loops, we will build on the code from `while_loop_count.py` and decorate the output a bit.

Instead of outputting each number on a separate line we will output them all on one line with a comma and a space between them. 

This lab is designed to focus a bit more on output while still relying on a `while` loop as the mechanism for driving the code.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the Sample Output *exactly*.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

^=^ ,

**NOTE:** You may find it easier to output numbers 0-8 on one line and then output the 9 after the `while` loop terminates.

^=

```
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
```

## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. You will need to change the comments (for instance, your name and the date).
