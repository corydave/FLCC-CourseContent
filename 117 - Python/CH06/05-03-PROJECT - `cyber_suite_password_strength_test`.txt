^^ PROJECT - `cyber_suite_password_strength_test`

## DESCRIPTION
Remember the rectangle lab from early on (it was just a bunch of `print()` statements)? Well we are revisiting it.

This time around, the user gets to pick a *height*. The software should always output the top and the bottom of the rectangle, but the height depends on the user's input.

Feel free to use either a `for` loop or a `while` loop - whatever you are more comfortable with.


## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the Sample Output *exactly*.
