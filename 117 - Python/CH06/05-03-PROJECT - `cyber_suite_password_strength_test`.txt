^^ PROJECT - `cyber_suite_password_strength_test`

## DESCRIPTION
Password security is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity. Strong passwords are resistant to brute force attacks and dictionary-based cracking attempts. This lab demonstrates how to use loops to analyze each character in a password and determine its strength based on various complexity factors.

A good way to attack this project is to walk through every character of the string and test it to see if it is uppercase, if it is lowercase, or if it is a digit. 

I recommend starting small - find an easy task like figuring out if a character is uppercase, lowercase, or a digit. Then build a bigger piece around that.

Unlike our previous password lab, in this lab we are broadening our acceptance of *special characters*:

<center>

`!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:'\",.<>/?`

</center>

Here is a good way to look at each letter in a string (one by one). Before this loop starts, you might want to have a variable that tracks how many lowercase letters there are. And how many uppercase. And how many special characters.

```python

# Create a password for this demonstration
# The real project will prompt the user for one
password = 'abcDEF123'

for letter in password:
  # code to examine the letter

```
Here is how the points shall be awarded:

## Scoring Components (Total: 100 points)
**Length Factor (25 points max)**
* 25 points: Password is 12+ characters
* 15 points: Password is 8-11 characters
* 10 points: Password is 6-7 characters
* 0 points: Password is less than 6 characters

<br />

**Character Variety (60 points max)**
* 15 points: Contains at least one uppercase letter
* 15 points: Contains at least one lowercase letter
* 15 points: Contains at least one digit
* 15 points: Contains at least one special character

<br />


**Character Type Diversity Bonus (15 points max)**
* 15 points: Uses 3 or more different character types

<br />

**Strength Categories**

1. STRONG: 80-100 points
2. MODERATE: 60-79 points
3. WEAK: 40-59 points
4. VERY WEAK: 0-39 points
