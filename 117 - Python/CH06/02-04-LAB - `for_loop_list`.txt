^^ LAB - `for_loop_list`

## DESCRIPTION
We're going to shift gears now and start looking at lists. While you don't need to know much about lists now (other than a *list* is one variable that hold multiple files - think of it as like a file cabinet drawer (that's one thing) that can hold multiple files (many things).

Here's a quick looksie at a list (again, don't get hung up on it now - we'll explore them more later):

```python

doggo_names = ['Maggie', 'Quinnie', 'BB-8', 'Yogi']

```

In this lab, we will merely print out every item in a list using a `for` loop. The code to grab the dog names from the user is already completed. You may want to examine that code since it will is a good example of how to collect information from a user using a `while` loop and then store it in a list.

You will be provided with a *list* of items and you'll only need to print the list. The list will change in each autotest - you'll only need to implement the `output_names()` function.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the Sample Output *exactly*.

* Be sure to watch both the **[More Print](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_R3xZTWfuo)** and **[For Loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usC1VA5lzDw)** videos first.
