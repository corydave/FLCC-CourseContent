^^ FLIP - Chapter #3 Reflection

Congratulations for making through the **third** week of programming! Random numbers are bonkers! Like, why would we want to seed a random number generator? That doesn't make much sense...


...or does it???

Please take this opportunity to reflect on the week. Reflection is a form of *metacognition* (that means thinking bout your thinking). These small exercises have been shown to improve thinking and learning. 

Here is the prompt for this week:

^=^ ,

Talk about `random` as it pertains to Python. I'd love for you to come up with an example of when you might want predictability when generating random numbers, and an example of a time when you really want a random number. 

I don't want to put you on the spot, though, so if you would prefer, you can just spout out one fact about random numbers (either related to Python or not).
