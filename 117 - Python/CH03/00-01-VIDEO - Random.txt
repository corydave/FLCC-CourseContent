^^ VIDEO - Random

A few takeaways from this video. First, you should recognize that the `random` module needs to be *imported* before using it. You'll also need to figure out how to create random numbers within a range. Lastly - and perhaps the most fun - you'll learn how to pick a random character from a collection of characters.
