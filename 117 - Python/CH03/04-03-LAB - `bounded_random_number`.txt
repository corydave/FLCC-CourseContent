^^ LAB - `bounded_random_number`


## DESCRIPTION

Write a program that takes in a number from the user, seeds the `random` module with that input, and then outputs a random number - within a specific range - using the `random` module in Python 

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* The filename for this program is `bounded_random_number.py`

* Complete the `bounded_random` function. This function should prompt the user for input and use the input to seed a random number generator. Then the function should produce a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive of both).

* Be sure to use `randint()`, not `randrange()`.

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top.

* The very first line of this program should be `import random`; if you do not include it you may have access to the `random` module.

* The auto-test for this program will check to see that a random number has been output *and* that the random number is specific to the seed that was used.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
Enter a seed for the random number generation: 33
10
```

```
Enter a seed for the random number generation: 32
2
```

```
Enter a seed for the random number generation: 100
3
```

## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. You will need to change the comments (for instance, your name and the date).
