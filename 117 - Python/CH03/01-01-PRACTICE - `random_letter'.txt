^^ PRACTICE - `random_letter`


## DESCRIPTION

Write a program that asks the user for a number of feet. Take the number they enter and do some math so that you can report how many miles there are (and any leftover feet). 

There are 5280 feet in a mile.

So if the user types in `5282` when prompted, the program should say that there is 1 mile with 2 feet left over.
