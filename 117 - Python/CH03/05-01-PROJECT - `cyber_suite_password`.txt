^^ LAB - `cyber_suite_password`


## DESCRIPTION

Write a program that takes in a number from the user, seeds the `random` module with that input, and then generates a random password following specific criteria:

1. The special characters are: `!@#$&(),-_`

2. The format is:

    1. One special character
    2. One lowercase letter
    3. One uppercase letter
    4. One lowercase letter
    5. One uppercase letter
    6. Two digits (numbers)
    7. One special character

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* The filename for this program is `cyber_suite_password.py`

* Complete the `generate_password` function. This function should prompt the user for input and use the input to seed a random number generator. Then the function should produce a random password with the given specifications.

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top.

* The very first line of this program should be `import random`; if you do not include it you may not have access to the `random` module.

* The very second line of this program should be `import string`; if you do not include it you may not have access to the `string` module.

* The auto-test for this program will check to see that a random password has been output *and* that the random number is specific to the seed that was used as input.

* Use `string.ascii_lowercase`, `string.ascii_uppercase`, and `string.digits` to generate the letters and numbers.

* Use `random.choice()` to choose random elements.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
Enter a seed for the random number generation: 33
Your random password is:
_fUhI78-
```

```
Enter a seed for the random number generation: 22
Your random password is:
#hAtO21(
```

```
Enter a seed for the random number generation: 0
Your random password is:
)yNbI87)
```

## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. You will need to change the comments (for instance, your name and the date).
