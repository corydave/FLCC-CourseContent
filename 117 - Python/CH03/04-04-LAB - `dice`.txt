^^ LAB - `dice`


## DESCRIPTION

Write a program that takes in a number from the user, seeds the `random` module with that input, and then outputs the value of two randomly rolled dice. 

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* The filename for this program is `dice.py`

* Complete the `roll_die` function. This function should prompt the user for input and use the input to seed a random number generator. Then the function should produce the result of a die rolled twice.

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top.

* The very first line of this program should be `import random`; if you do not include it you may have access to the `random` module.

* The auto-test for this program will check to see that a random number has been output *and* that the random number is specific to the seed that was used as input.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
Enter a seed for the random number generation: 33
Die roll one is 5
Die roll two is 2
```

```
Enter a seed for the random number generation: 22
Die roll one is 2
Die roll two is 2
```

```
Enter a seed for the random number generation: -30
Die roll one is 5
Die roll two is 3
```

## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. You will need to change the comments (for instance, your name and the date).
