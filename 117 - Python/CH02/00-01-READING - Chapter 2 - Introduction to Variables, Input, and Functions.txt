The reading for this chapter is [Chapter 2 - Introduction to Variables, Input, and Functions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AScW49_joO4hAujiOTHODn50002orVZ4i--ztcCoZ_k/edit#heading=h.554rsk6pbo1). There are some really neat things here that will set us up for more robust programming later on. Here's the thing - sometimes it's better to five into one topic and explore every nook and cranny. Sometimes it is better to explore a few different topics with a brief investigation (because getting some experience, even shallow, is better for cooler programs). I'm thinking this is one of the times when it's better to learn just a little bit (because we will gain more experience down the road).

One thing to keep an eye out for is **functions** (also called methods in other languages). Functions are a cool way to organize code - they are like mini-programs. Moving forward, we'll be writing every program with a function called `main` because that is what will be run by the computer. Of course, we can have a ton of different functions. But `main` will be the main function that kickstarts the rest of the functions!

Here is the *proper* way to write the `helloWorld` program:

```python ^copy

# Define a function called 'main'
def main():
    print('Hello, World!')

# Invoke the 'main' function
main();

```
