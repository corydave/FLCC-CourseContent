^^ Letters && Numbers

We will be looking at three different topics in this chapter. 

1. **Variables** are ways to hold data in memory for a while. For instance, when you play a video game and the game asks you your name. That information (your name) is stored in a variable that can be recalled later. That variable is probably called `name`, though it might be called `first_name` or `players_name`.

2. **Input** is a way to capture, well, input from the user. Usually we store the value of the input (what the user types) into a variable (see above!).

3. **Types** are the type of data that variables can hold. For now, there are only two types:
    1. *String* - a whole bunch of letters. A name is a string. A sentence is a string. We see this in Python as `str`.
    2. *Number* - a number. There are two kinds - `int` stands for *integer* which means a whole number (can be negative!) and `float` which means decimal. Your age is an `int` and your GPA is a `float`.

We'll be doing deeper dives on all three of these concepts later, but if you start learning them now we'll be able to do some real sick stuff later in the course!

# Prediction
What do you think this code does? What do you think is the difference between `capitalize()` and `upper()`?


```python

name = input("What is your name? ")
print('Nice to meet you,', name.capitalize())
print('Nice to meet you,', name.upper())

```
