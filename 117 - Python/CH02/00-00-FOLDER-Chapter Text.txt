^^ Introduction to Variables, Input, and Functions

We will be looking at three different topics in this chapter. 

1. **Variables** are ways to hold data in memory for a while. For instance, when you play a video game and the game asks you your name. That's probably stored in a variable called `name`.

2. **Input** is a way to capture, well, input from the user. Usually we store the value of the input (what the user types) into a variable (see above!).

3. **Functions** are like little mini-programs in your program.

We'll be doing deeper dives on all three of these concepts later, but if you start learning them now we'll be able to do some real sick stuff later in the course!

# Prediction
What do you think this code does? What do you think is the difference between `capitalize()` and `upper()`?


```python

name = input("What is your name? ")
print('Nice to meet you,', name.capitalize())
print('Nice to meet you,', name.upper())

```
