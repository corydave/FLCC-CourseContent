^^ FLIP - Chapter #2 Reflection

Congratulations for making through the second week of programming! I think the hardest thing to wrap your head around when learning programming is how variables work.

Please take this opportunity to reflect on the week. Reflection is a form of metacognition (that means thinking bout your thinking). These small exercises have been shown to improve thinking and learning.

Here is the prompt for this week:

I'm interested in your explanation of variables (in Python). Pretend you are explaining how you use variables in programming to a ten year old. Honestly, I think this is a great exercise and helps me understand how people new to programming contextualize the notion of input and variables.
