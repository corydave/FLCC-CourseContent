^^ LAB - `triangleArea`


## DESCRIPTION

Write a program that uses the height and the base of a triangle to compute the area of the triangle using the formula `A = 1/2 * b * h`. Output the result in the exact format shown below.


```
Enter the height: 10
Enter the base: 5

The area of the triangle is 25.0
```

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* The filename for this program is `triangleArea.py`

* Complete the `findArea()` function. The function should ask for the measure of the height and the base and then output the area.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
Enter the height: 1
Enter the base: 1

The area of the triangle is 0.5
```

```
Enter the height: 8
Enter the base: 4

The area of the triangle is 16.0
```

## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. You will need to change the comments (for instance, your name and the date).
