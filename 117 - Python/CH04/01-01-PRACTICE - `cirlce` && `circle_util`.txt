^^ PRACTICE - `circle` && `circle_util`


## DESCRIPTION

Write a program that:

1. Asks the user for a number to use as the radius of a circle.
2. Output the area of the circle.
3. Output the circumference of the circle.
4. This *must* use two files - `circle.py` (which controls the flow of the program) and `circle_util.py` (which does the dirty work like all the mathy things).

## SPECIFICATIONS

* File names: `circle.py`, `circle_util.py`
* There is no grade associated with this practice exercise
* There is a video walkthrough below

<br /><br />

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
What is the circle radius? 1


The area is 3.141592653589793

The circumference is 6.283185307179586
```

```
What is the circle radius? 0


The area is 0.0

The circumference is 0.0
```

```
What is the circle radius? 10


The area is 314.1592653589793

The circumference is 62.83185307179586
```

## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. Be sure to put both files in the same directory (folder)!

^callout file-download

[`circle.py`](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Zzt9GCBgnuImTNvcy9-KlR8THpNvANJL)

[`circle_util.py`](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1UKz3fOvGfX7HgjDcCA-PnhKsaId4oNQs)

Download these files and load them into your IDE *in the same directory*.

## SOLUTION

^acc

^^^ `circle.py`

```python ^copy

# SOLUTION for `circle.py`

# FILE NAME: circle.py
# This is the main driver; it will rely on functions in `circle_util.py`

import circle_util

radius = float(input('What is the circle radius? '))

# circle_util.test()

print()
print()

circle_util.area(radius)
print()
circle_util.circumference(radius)


```

^^^ `circle_util.py`

```python ^copy

# FILE NAME: circle_util.py
# This is a helper file for the `circle.py` file. It contains functions that
# the main program can call!

import math

def test():
    print('circle_util is working')

def area(r):
    circle_area = math.pi * r * r
    print(f'The area is {circle_area}')

def circumference(radius):
    circle_circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius
    print(f'The circumference is {circle_circumference}')

```
