^^ LAB - `fortune_machine`

## DESCRIPTION

This is the first lab (in a series) that explores importing custom modules. In this case, you will be provided with the `fortune_util` module and you will have to use it to craft a program that provides a good experience for the user.

There are functions you can use from the `fortune_util` module. Note that all three of these functions are tested and require no code modification. You are welcome to tinker around in this code, but when you submit this assignment you will only be submitting `fortune_machine.py` as the `fortune_util.py` file resides on the testing server at CodeGrade.
* `get_directions()` takes in no arguments and merely outputs the instructions to the user.
* `get_one_fortune()` takes in no arguments and outputs one fortune for the user.
* `get_multiple_fortunes(num)` takes in one argument - an integer - and outputs that number of fortunes.
* `dashes()` takes in no arguments and outputs a line of 40 dashes `'-'`
* `quit()` takes no parameters and displays a goodbye message.

Ideally this software would be more effective with loops and `if` statements so we could craft a smooth, logical experience for the user. But since we haven't explored that yet, we will live with what we have and just call each function in order. 

But stay tuned - in the not-too-distant future we will be coming back to this lab and making it a better user experience.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab - there are two files:
    * `fortune_machine.py` is what will be run when you submit to CodeGrade. This is the only file you will be submitting as the `fortune_util.py` file resides on the server at CodeGrade.
    * `fortune_util.py` is the utility file that supports the main program. You do not have to modify this program, but you should be familiar with the functions in it.

* The filename for the program you will be submitting is `fortune_machine.py`

* Complete the function `run_fortune_machine` in `fortune_machine.py` as described in the comments of the code.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!
