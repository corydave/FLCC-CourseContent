We can (quite easily - especially compared to other programming languages) open a file, write to it, read from it, and augment it. It's actually remarkably easy. To create (or open) a file, you first need to decide if you want to *read* the contents or *write* to the contents. If you want to write, you have to know if you are going to *add to* the current contents of the file or *overwrite* the current contents:

```python

# opens a file for reading
file = open('names.txt', 'r')

# opens a file for adding to (appending)
file = open('text.txt', 'a')

# opens a file for overwriting
file = open('data.txt', 'w')

```

We can also work with directories (folders) by importing `os`. You'll see examples of both of these in the chapter. Hopefully you'll start seeing some of the really cool things we can do with these potent tools.
