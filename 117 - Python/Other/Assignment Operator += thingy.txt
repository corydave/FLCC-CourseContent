^^ HINT FOR `password` LAB

# Build your string one character at a time!
Some people have already submitted - and passed! - the `password` lab. I saw some unique solutions that I wasn't expecting but totally loved!

I thought I might save you some struggle by introducing you to a new operator. You can use `+=` to build a string one character at a time (technically it is used to add to the current state of a variable).

Consider this:

```python

name = 'Dav'
name += 'e'
name += ' G'
name += 'hidi'
name += 'u'

print(name)
# OUTPUT: Dave Ghidiu

```
When dealing with a string, you can *append* (that is, add to the end) extra characters. 

The operator behaves similarly with numbers; it just takes the current state of the variable and adds to it. You probably don't need that for this lab, lab, but it's good to know:

```python

numberOne = 33
numberOne += 10
print(numberOne)
# OUTPUT: 43

```

Lastly, there are different flavors of this operator:

```python

numberTwo = 10
numberTwo += 12 # 22
numberTwo /= 2  # 11.0
numberTwo -= 3  # 8.0
numberTwo *= 4  # 32.0

```

Hope that helps!
