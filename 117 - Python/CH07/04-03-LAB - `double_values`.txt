^^ LAB - `double_values`

## DESCRIPTION
In this exercise we will be modifying the values in a `list` in Python. The user will choose how many numbers they want to add to the `list`. Then they will populate that `list`. Finally, the program will output the `list` (both naturally, then sorted, then doubled).

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the Sample Output *exactly*.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT
