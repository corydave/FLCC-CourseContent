^^ PROJECT - `password_strength_analyzer`

## DESCRIPTION
Write a Python script that asks the user to enter a password. Your program will evaluate the password based on five categories: length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Each category will receive a score based on the criteria below. At the end, print:

1. A summary report of how the password performed in each category.

2. The total score and the percentage (out of a maximum score of 40).

Use the scoring matrix below:

| LENGTH                   | Points |
|:-------------------------|:------:|
| Fewer than 8 characters  | 0      |
| 8 - 15 characters        | 5      |
| More than 15 characters  | 8      |

| UPPERCASE LETTERS        | Points |
|:-------------------------|:------:|
| No uppercase letters     | 0      |
| 1 uppercase letter       | 2      |
| 2 uppercase letters      | 4      |
| More than 2              | 8      |

| LOWERCASE LETTERS        | Points |
|:-------------------------|:------:|
| No lowercase letters     | 0      |
| 1 lowercase letter       | 2      |
| 2 lowercase letters      | 4      |
| More than 2              | 8      |

| NUMBERS                  | Points |
|:-------------------------|:------:|
| No numbers               | 0      |
| 1 numbers                | 2      |
| 2 numbers                | 4      |
| More than 2              | 8      |

| SPECIAL CHARACTERS       | Points |
|:-------------------------|:------:|
| No special characters    | 0      |
| 1 special character      | 2      |
| 2 special characters     | 4      |
| More than 2              | 8      |

<sup>*</sup>NOTE: A special character is any character that is not a letter or number.
