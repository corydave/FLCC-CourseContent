^^ LAB - `double_values`

## DESCRIPTION
In this exercise we will be modifying the values in a `list` in Python. The user will choose how many numbers they want to add to the `list`. Then they will populate that `list`. Finally, the program will output the `list` (both naturally, then sorted, then doubled).

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the Sample Output *exactly*.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT


```
How many numbers will you be entering? 5
What is number? 1
What is number? 9
What is number? 2
What is number? 8
What is number? 7

ORIGINAL -          [1, 9, 2, 8, 7]
ORIGINAL (sorted) - [1, 2, 7, 8, 9]
DOUBLED -           [2, 4, 14, 16, 18]
```

<br />

```
How many numbers will you be entering? 0

ORIGINAL -          []
ORIGINAL (sorted) - []
DOUBLED -           []
```

<br />

```
How many numbers will you be entering? 1
What is number? 3

ORIGINAL -          [3]
ORIGINAL (sorted) - [3]
DOUBLED -           [6]
```

<br />

```
How many numbers will you be entering? 9
What is number? 193
What is number? 265
What is number? 295
What is number? -54
What is number? -523 
What is number? 463
What is number? 574
What is number? 2  
What is number? 0

ORIGINAL -          [193, 265, 295, -54, -523, 463, 574, 2, 0]
ORIGINAL (sorted) - [-523, -54, 0, 2, 193, 265, 295, 463, 574]
DOUBLED -           [-1046, -108, 0, 4, 386, 530, 590, 926, 1148]

    # First, let's figure out how many numbers the user will be entering:
    size = int(input('How many numbers will you be entering? '))

    # yet as we will just be appending to it.

    # Guess we'll need a loop to populate the loop:
    while len(numbers) < size:
        
        # Here's the tricky part. Stay with me! We have to ask the user to
        # input a number using the `input` function. Then we have to cast
        # it to an `int` before we append it. Otherwise, the list `numbers`
        # will be full of `strings`!
