^^ PROJECT - `mfa_simulator`

## DESCRIPTION

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a critical security measure that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system. One common MFA method is a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP), where a unique code is generated for a short period of time.

In this lab, you'll create a simple MFA code generator and validator that demonstrates the basic concept of one-time security codes.

## WALKTHROUGH

### Part 1: Create an MFA Code Generator
1. Ask the user for a seed
2. Generate a list of 10 random numbers (six digits long each)
3. Displays the codes to the user

### Part 2: Validate MFA Codes
1. Ask the user to input a security code
2. Check if the entered code matches any code in your valid codes list
3. If the code is not in the list, the user is denied access.
4. If the code is in the list, the user is granted access and the code is removed from the list.
5. The remaining codes are displayed.
