^^ LAB - `output_right`

## DESCRIPTION
In this exercise we will continue to hone our `list` manipulation skills. We will be taking input from the user as they provide integers for a `list`. When they are done, we will output all the elements in the list--in order--with one caveat: the last item in the list will be output as the first item. 

Here is the use case scenario:

^=^ ,, 10

Hospitals have a triage system. As patients come in, they register at the triage desk and are assigned a spot in line based on the severity of their ailment. Some cases get triaged to the immediate front. That's what this protocol is. We are taking the last person - the one that just walked in - and pushing them to the front of the line.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the Sample Output *exactly*.

* Your program *must* alter the structure of the `list` by moving the last item to the first spot. The `pop()` function works well for removing an item (by index number) from a `list` and the `insert()` function works perfectly for, well, inserting an item.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT


```
Enter the name of the guest: Alice
Enter the name of the guest: Bob
Enter the name of the guest: Charlie
Enter the name of the guest: Danielle
Enter the name of the guest: EOF

['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Danielle']
['Danielle', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
```

<br />

```
Enter the name of the guest: Eliza
Enter the name of the guest: EOF

['Eliza']
['Eliza']
```

<br />

```
Enter the name of the guest: 1234
Enter the name of the guest: 2345
Enter the name of the guest: 3456
Enter the name of the guest: 4567
Enter the name of the guest: EOF

['1234', '2345', '3456', '4567']
['4567', '1234', '2345', '3456']
```

<br />
