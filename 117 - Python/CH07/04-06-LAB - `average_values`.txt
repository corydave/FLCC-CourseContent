^^ LAB - `average_values`

## DESCRIPTION
This is the final exercise designed to increase your experience working with `list`s in Python. For this experience, the user will keep typing in numbers. When they are done, they will type "`DONE`". 

The program will output the `list` that includes the numbers that were entered, the sum of the numbers, and the average. Compute the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the `list`.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the Sample Output *exactly*.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT
