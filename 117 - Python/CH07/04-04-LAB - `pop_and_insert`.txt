^^ LAB - `pop_and_insert`

## DESCRIPTION
In this exercise, we will hone our `list` manipulation skills. We will be taking input from the user as they provide integers for a `list`. When they are done, we will output all the elements in the list (in order) with one caveat: the first item in the list will be output as the last item. 

Programmatically, there are two ways to approach this. The first method includes not disturbing the order of the items in the `list`:
1. Print out items 1-9
2. Print out item 0

Alternatively, you could just *pop* the first item and append it to the `list` and then print the `list`.

We will choose the second option that physically reorganizes the `list`. Here is the use case scenario:

^=^ ,, 10

The DMV has a policy that mandates all customers get a ticket when they enter. Customers are called up in order (based on their numbers). If a customer is called up and they are not prepared (for instance, they have forgotten their license plate number and have to go check it or they need to visit the ATM to get cash as some transactions require cash only) then that customer is refused service, given a new number (at the end of the line), and has to properly prepare.

^=

Don't forget that `.pop(0)` will remove the first item in a list. For instance, if the list is called `doggo_names` and has the following values:

`['BB-8', 'Quinnie', 'Maggie']`

then the code below will take `'BB-8'` out of the list and store it as `first_doggo`:

`first_doggo = doggo_names.pop(0)`


## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the Sample Output *exactly*.

* Your program *must* alter the structure of the `list` by moving the first item to the last spot. The `pop()` function works well for removing an item (by index number) from a `list` and `append(item)` is great for tacking it on to the back of the list.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT


```
Enter the name of the customer: Alice
Enter the name of the customer: Bob
Enter the name of the customer: Charlie
Enter the name of the customer: Danielle
Enter the name of the customer: EOF

['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Danielle']
['Bob', 'Charlie', 'Danielle', 'Alice']
```

<br />

```
Enter the name of the customer: Eliza
Enter the name of the customer: EOF

['Eliza']
['Eliza']
```

<br />

```
Enter the name of the customer: 1234
Enter the name of the customer: 2345
Enter the name of the customer: 3456
Enter the name of the customer: 4567
Enter the name of the customer: EOF

['1234', '2345', '3456', '4567']
['2345', '3456', '4567', '1234']
```
