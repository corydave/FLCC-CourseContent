Do you know the difference between *encoding*, *encrypting*, and *hashing*? 

* *Encoding* translates a data into characters that use a smaller subset (many encoding schemes use letters, numbers, and the "`+`" sign and "`/`" sign only). Data can be easily encoded or decoded - and there is no security or secrets.<br /><br />
* *Encryption* uses a "key" to lock data into an unrecognizable state - the data can *only* be decrypted with a key. Encrypted data is secure from prying eyes.<br /><br />
* *Hashing* is a one-way conversion of data. There is no way to derive the original data from a hash.

Can you think of times when you might want to encode? How about times when you might want to encrypt? What about hashing?
