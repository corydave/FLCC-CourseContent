^^ LAB - `encoding`

## DESCRIPTION
In this program, you are tasked with retrieving data from a text file and encoding them so that they can be used safely in other applications.

The data must be encoded in base64, so the default encoding function in Python should not be used.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top.

* The output will be a byte literal - no need to convert the result.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT


```
File name? data01.txt
b'VGhpcyBpcyB0aGUgbWVzc2FnZS4='
```
<br />

```
File name? data02.txt
b'VGhpcyBpcyB0aGUgY2xvY2sgc29uZwpJJ20gc2V0dGluZyBhbGwgdGhlIGNsb2NrcyB3cm9uZw=='
```
