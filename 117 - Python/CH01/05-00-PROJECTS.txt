^^ PROJECTS

Projects are typically a bit longer than labs. They will draw on a pretty solid understanding of the programming concepts covered in the course. You'll need to plan a bit more than you would for labs. You'll need to think about the design of the program and the flow of the program.

You will not see the projects for this chapter unless you score 80% or better on the chapter quiz.
