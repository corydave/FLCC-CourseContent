If you have programmed in Java before, this small chapter will blow your mind (at the simplicity of Python). Consider this code from Java (to be clear, you are *not* responsible for any Java in this course):

```java
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

In Python, the code to do the *same thing* is:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

Yeah. That's it. It's that simple.

Since this is our first chapter with Python, there are still some things to get used to. In this chapter you'll find a video about understanding how each chapter works - including using *Jupyter Notebooks*. Then we'll look at how to submit work to CodeGrade. We'll also look at how ChatGPT can be super dumb sometimes. Then, it's off to the races - the Python Races. And by that I mean we'll just program. There's really no race.
