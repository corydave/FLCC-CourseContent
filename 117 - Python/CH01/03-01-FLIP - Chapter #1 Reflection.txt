^^ FLIP - Chapter #1 Reflection

Congratulations for making through the first week of programming! There are *a lot* of things that were probably new to you. 

1. Python
2. Google Cloud Shell
3. CodeGrade
4. Maybe even Brightspace

Please take this opportunity to reflect on the week. Reflection is a form of *metacognition* (that means thinking bout your thinking). These small exercises have been shown to improve thinking and learning. 

Here is the prompt for this week:

^=^ ,

Please share ONE thing that you learned during this week. Perhaps it is a mistake you made and you learned from. Maybe it's something you think you'll find handy for every program you write. 


It is okay if the thing you share has already been shared by someone else; it's good to know what people think is hard when first starting to program.
