^^ PROJECT - `cyber_suite`

Throughout this course, we will be building small components that will be assembled into a big program. This is the first stage. You'll be making small programs every chapter, so make sure you store your code where you can find it.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Be sure to add your name at the top of your program using comments.  (ie. `#Jane Smith`  ).
