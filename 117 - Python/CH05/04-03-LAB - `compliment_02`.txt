^^ LAB - `compliment_02`

## DESCRIPTION
Building off of `compliment_01.py`, this program goes a step further and will have custom output for `yes` as well as not `yes` (see the Sample Output for more details).

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* The `if` statement should compare user input to the string `yes`. Any deviation from `yes` should default to the `No compliment for you!` message.

* You can compare strings using the `==` operator:

```python

if first_name == 'Dave':
  print('Hiya!')
else:
  print("Dave's not here right now!")
```

<br /><br />
