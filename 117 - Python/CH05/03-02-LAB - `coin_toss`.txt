^^ LAB - `coin_toss`

## DESCRIPTION
This program is a simple application that will randomly return `Heads` or `Tails`. To calculate, a random number 
between 1 and 100 (inclusive) is generated and if the number is 51 or greater then `Tails` is reported. Otherwise `Heads` is reported.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* There is no seed for the random number so code will be evaluated manually.
