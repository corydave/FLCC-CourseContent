^^ LAB - `grade_converter`

## DESCRIPTION
Most learning management systems (Blackboard, Brightspace, etc.) have a feature where grades can be expressed as either percentages or letters. This experience will ask for a percentage and - using the table found in the specifications - return the corresponding letter grade.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the Sample Output *exactly*.

* Using mathematical bracket notation where `[...]` means *inclusive* and `(...)` means *exclusive*, the scale is below. As an example, the grade 70 would be converted to a `C`.
