^^ LAB - `firewall_traffic_analyzer`

## DESCRIPTION

Write a program that considers two pieces of data and makes a risk analysis. The program monitors data transfers to a network and the risk assessment is based on the port number as well as the size of the transfer.

1. Prompt the user for:
    * The port number as an `int` (e.g., 80, 22, 443, 3389).
    * The data transfer size in megabytes 
 as in `int` (MB).

2. Categorize traffic using `if-elif-else`:
    * If port 22 (SSH) and transfer size > 500MB output "**HIGH RISK: Potential unauthorized remote access detected!**"
    * Else if port 80 (HTTP) with transfer size > 100MB output "**MEDIUM RISK: Large unencrypted data transfer detected.**"
    * Else if port 443 (HTTPS) output "**LOW RISK: Secure encrypted transfer detected.**"
    * Else output "**UNKNOWN: Unrecognized traffic pattern.**"

Print a firewall log message summarizing the risk level.

Good news! You'll get to use another new Python skill! Conditionals can be *compound* that means they can have an `and` or an `or`:

```python
port_number = 21

if port_number == 21 or 22:
  print('File transfer')
```

<br />

You can use an `and` statement the same way:

```python
port_number = 3889
transfer_size = 675

if port_number == 3889 and transfer_size > 500:
  print('Suspicious activity')
```

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* The filename for this program is `firewall_traffic_analyzer.py`

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
=== Network Traffic Security Analyzer ===

Enter the port number (e.g., 80, 22, 443, 3389): 80
Enter the data transfer size in megabytes (MB): 120

FIREWALL LOG:
Port: 80, Transfer Size: 120 MB
Risk Assessment: MEDIUM RISK: Large unencrypted data transfer detected.
------------------------
```

```
=== Network Traffic Security Analyzer ===

Enter the port number (e.g., 80, 22, 443, 3389): 22
Enter the data transfer size in megabytes (MB): 12

FIREWALL LOG:
Port: 22, Transfer Size: 12 MB
Risk Assessment: HIGH RISK: Potential unauthorized remote access detected!
------------------------
```

```
=== Network Traffic Security Analyzer ===

Enter the port number (e.g., 80, 22, 443, 3389): 443
Enter the data transfer size in megabytes (MB): 1024

FIREWALL LOG:
Port: 443, Transfer Size: 1024 MB
Risk Assessment: LOW RISK: Secure encrypted transfer detected.
------------------------
```

```
=== Network Traffic Security Analyzer ===

Enter the port number (e.g., 80, 22, 443, 3389): 1725
Enter the data transfer size in megabytes (MB): 234567

FIREWALL LOG:
Port: 1725, Transfer Size: 234567 MB
Risk Assessment: UNKNOWN: Unrecognized traffic pattern.
------------------------
```
