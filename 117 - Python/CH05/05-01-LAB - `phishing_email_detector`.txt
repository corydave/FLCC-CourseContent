^^ LAB - `phishing_email_detector`


## DESCRIPTION

Write a program that analyzes an email subject line to detect phishing attempts based on common red flags:

1. Prompt the user to enter an email subject line (as a string).

2. Check for phishing indicators using `if-elif-else` and output an appropriate warning message:
    * If the subject contains "**urgent**" or "**immediate action required**" output "**HIGH RISK: Possible phishing attempt.**"

    * Else if the subject contains "**win**" or "**free**" output "**MEDIUM RISK: Suspicious offer detected.**"

    * Else if the subject contains "**password reset**" output "**LOW RISK: Verify legitimacy with sender.**"

    * Else output "**No phishing indicators detected.**"

Good news! You'll get to use a new Python skill! When looking at strings, there is an operator called `in` that works like this:

```python
full_name = 'Dave Ghidiu'

if 'Ghi' in full_name:
    print('PARTIAL MATCH')

# This will output PARTIAL MATCH
```

Note that the `in` is case sensitive! So the inquiry 
```python
if 'ghi' in full_name:
# 'ghi' is not in 'Ghi', so there is no match
```
would be negative. However, if we don't care about capitalization, we could use this:

```python
full_name = 'Dave Ghidiu'

if 'ghi' in full_name.lower():
    print('PARTIAL MATCH')

# This will output PARTIAL MATCH as well
```

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
Enter the email subject line: Meeting on Friday

SECURITY ASSESSMENT:
No phishing indicators detected.
