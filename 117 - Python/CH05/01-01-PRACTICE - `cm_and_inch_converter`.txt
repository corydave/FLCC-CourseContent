^^ PRACTICE - `cm_and_inch_converter`


## DESCRIPTION

Write a program that:

1. Asks the user if they would like to convert centimeters to inches or inches to centimeters.
2. Based on their decision, the program will:
   1. Ask the user for a number and convert it to inches
   2. Ask the user for a number and convert it to centimeters
3. There are 2.54 centimeters for every one inch

## SPECIFICATIONS

* File name: `cm_and_inch_converter.py`
* There is no grade associated with this practice exercise
* There is a video walkthrough below

<br /><br />

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
Welcome to the converter. Please choose from the following menu:
1. Convert from cm to in
2. Convert from in to cm

1

Enter the number of centimeters: 3
3 centimeters is 1.1811 inches
```

```

## SOLUTION

^acc

^^^ `circle.py`

```python ^copy

# SOLUTION for `circle.py`

# FILE NAME: circle.py
# This is the main driver; it will rely on functions in `circle_util.py`

import circle_util

radius = float(input('What is the circle radius? '))

# circle_util.test()

print()
print()

circle_util.area(radius)
print()
circle_util.circumference(radius)


```

def area(r):
    circle_area = math.pi * r * r
    print(f'The area is {circle_area}')

def circumference(radius):
    circle_circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius
