^^ LAB - `stock_scraper`

## DESCRIPTION
In this exercise we will be exploring some lightweight web scraping. Essentially we will be building a bot to scrape different web pages (so we, as humans, don't need to go to each one individually).

Note that web scraping can often violate terms of service (or might be illegal!), depending on laws and site policies.

In this lab, we will be using a site I own (https://phishingdemo.org/). I have designed some fictional stock information sites - if they happen to coincide with real stocks, please do not make any investments based on the information presented! 

Your job will be to:

1. Ask a user for a stock to check
2. Have your bot return the current value of that stock

If you haven't watched [the video on web scraping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iTbjlE2BK0) yet, you'll need it to understand this task.

Here are some guidelines to help you understand the schema of the stocks:

* The base URL is: `https://phishingdemo.org/python/scraping/`. To that, append the stock symbol and `.html`. For instance, if the stock is BB8, the URL is `https://phishingdemo.org/python/scraping/BB8.html`

* The format of every page is exactly the same.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* You will need to install some packages on your system:

^=^ ,,,,

```
pip3 install requests
pip3 install --update requests
pip2 install beautifulsoup4
```
^=

* You will need to ask the user for a stock symbol

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the Sample Output *exactly*.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT


```
Enter a stock symbol: DAVE
233.29
```

<br />

```
Enter a stock symbol: BB8
202.20
```

<br />

```
Enter a stock symbol: KATY
311.23
```

<br />


## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. You will need to change the comments (for instance, your name and the date).
