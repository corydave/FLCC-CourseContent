Which of the following is true about grappling with failure while learning to program?

<!--

You will get frustrated so many times this semester, but stick with it!

Labs that fail the autotest may not be resubmitted.

If 10% of your labs fail the autotesting, you cannot pass the course.

There is no way to test your labs.
