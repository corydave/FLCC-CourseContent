How many times a week should you devote to Python?

<!--

One day of playing with Python is the best way to learn.

Being able to practice Python 2 to 4 times a week is optimal.

It is imperative that you spend at least 5 days a week (30 minutes a day) on Python.

There is no recommendation for how to spread your time across the week when it comes to learning Python.
