^^ LAB - Setup GitHub

In this lab you will create a GitHub account (if you already have one, you may choose to use it).

Please use your FLCC email account - in the video I mention that you don't have to, but you might need to use the FLCC account to get access to some of the features in our grading system.

When you are done, please take a screenshot and submit it. Check out this video tutorial!
