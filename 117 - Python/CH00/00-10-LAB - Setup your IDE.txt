This is a quick assignment - you'll be setting up the software where you will program. In the biz, this is called an IDE *(Integrated Development Environment)*. It has a place to type your code (an editor), a way to run your program (a compiler), a way to test your program (a debugger), and all sorts of other bells and whistles.

We will be using a cloud-based IDE for this class. You can find it at https://shell.cloud.google.com - as long as you are logged into your Google account, you'll have access to this IDE!

If you'd rather install an IDE on your computer, the IDE of choice for most developers - across all programming languages - is Visual Studio Code by Microsoft. It's free! It's awesome!

If you want to install that on your computer, go for it. You'll also have to install Python and maybe some other software. I don't provide much technical support for installing on your computer. 

Google Cloud Shell, by the way, is essentially Visual Studio Code.
