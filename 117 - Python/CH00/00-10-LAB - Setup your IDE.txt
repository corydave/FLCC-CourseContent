^^ LAB - Setup your IDE 

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is software that programmers use to, well, program. An IDE does a number of things:

1. It gives us a place to type code
2. It gives us a *debugger* to help with errors in our code
3. It runs our code
4. It has auto-complete!

There are a ton of things IDEs do - we will just be scratching the surface of features. Many developers prefer to download an IDE to their computer(s). The IDE of choice is Visual Studio Code. 

HOWEVER! We will be doing things a bit differently; we will be using a cloud-based IDE. It's easy to setup! Please watch the video and follow along!
