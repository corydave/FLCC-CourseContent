I want to get to know you! We will be using Webex to chat and meetings are usually only five or ten minutes long.

* Webex is a free app for mobile devices, but if you're on a computer you don't even need an app. The URL of my Webex room is https://flcc.webex.com/meet/dave.ghidiu

* ***Don't panic!!!*** These meetings aren't painful. I just wanna get to know you!!!

<br />

Even if we've worked together in the past and we've had meetings, please schedule a meeting anyhow - I want to see your beautiful, smiling face!

Please email me a few dates and times that work for you. My email address is dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu - I'll find one that works and email you back confirmation ðŸ˜ƒ

You'll get credit for the meeting once we meet.

# Specifications

* Email me at dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu a few days and times to meet.

* Please pick a date in the first four weeks of the summer if possible.

* The meeting is low anxiety! If you don't want to have your camera on, don't turn it on. We'll just have a light conversation. Feel free to ask me questions (about class or about anything else). If you don't want to answer a question, just say, "Pass".
