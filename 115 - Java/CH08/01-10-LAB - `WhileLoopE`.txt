^^ LAB - `WhileLoopE`

## DESCRIPTION
Using a `while` loop, write a program that will ask the user if they want to play a game. As long as they don't enter the word "`no`", the loop will iterate.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the sample output exactly.

* The code to complete the task should be in a separate method that is called by the `main` method

* The condition in the `while` statement should ignore case (hint: there's a `String` method for this- check the class notes on `String` or the Relevant API)
