The reading for this chapter is [Chapter 8 - Loops](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HAPpbdoJkwmobvSKDeNsoJD_9xki7YR7NdEBFJzfojs/edit). 

We'll be looking at *loops* in this chapter. A loop is a line of code (or many lines of code) that repeat over and over until a condition is met. We'll be looking at `for` loops and `while` loops in this chapter.

As you are reading, please make sure you leave comments in the margins (you can highlight text in the document and leave a comment). Perhaps you notice a typo. Maybe you have something to add. Or maybe you just want to add a question that someone else can answer for you.
