^^ WE ARE EXPERIENCING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES

# ERROR DOES NOT COMPUTE

We're figuring out the best way forward - I know there are issues with Blackboard and Brightspace. 

Please standby as we remedy the situation. Two things to keep in mind:

1. Any work you've already submitted will be credited!

2. We'll get through this, it won't affect your grades, we'll realign the due dates, and thanks for your flexibility.
