        // called `printRectangle()`. Think of this as
        // a little mini-program or bot. You shouldn't 
        // add any code here - add code to the next method.
		printRectangle(); // calls method to print the rectangle
    
	}
	
    // NEW!!!! 
	// this method prints the rectangle to the screen
	public static void printRectangle() {
