# Blackboard it is!
Hey folks - 

Thank you for your patience. I know it's been a wild ride so far this summer (and it's only been one day!). After the dust has settled, it looks like we will not be using *Brightspace* after all. We will be using Blackboard (you can [access it here](https://classroom.suny.edu/)). 

Because I did not know about this, there is no content in your Blackboard course. I'll work hard in the next few hours to make sure it's all set and good to go. Since you were minorly derailed for a day, I'm happy to extend the due dates for anything that *should* have been due next week on June 7 to the week after. This doesn't push back any other due dates (including what normally would have been due on June 14). I wouldn't recommend waiting, though, to get that work in üòÅ.

Thanks again for your patience!
