^^ WEEK 02 - Midweek Check In

# A quick note
Hey folks - I just wanted to say that I know this week also seems a bit wonky since you don't have feedback on some of your assignments yet. Again, that's just because of the way Mimir works. In the announcement in the beginning of the week I talked about how to let me know you want feedback before the due date.

Also, Chapters 3 and 4 are both in "Upcoming Experiences". In the video for this announcement, I talk about how Chapters 3 and 4 really ramp up (especially Chapter 4). ***DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE FOR CHAPTER 4!!!*** This is probably the biggest derailment point in the class. I know from experience that when people wait until the last few days to do the work in Chapter 4 that they never quite recover for the rest of the semester. My suggestion would be to rip through Chapter 3 (which doesn't officially start until Wednesday of next week) and then dedicate a week and a half or two weeks to Chapter 4.

If you need anything, lemme know!
