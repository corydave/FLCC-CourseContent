^^ WEEK 01 - Midweek Check In

# Up and running!
Hey folks! I've put together the first chapter (it's called Chapter 0) in Blackboard. It's going to be a process to move over the rest of the content, but I will definitely have the next chapter up in the next few days, and the rest of the content in a week or two.

Thank you SO MUCH for your patience!

All work that was due June 7 will now be due June 14 (but please try to get the work in before then so you don't have a ton of work to do next week). Even if the calendar dates say June 7, there is no late penalty.

Here's a [link to the orientation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKphyviGb4w) if you can't find it in Blackboard.

Please note that there are TWO chapters published - Chapter 0 and Chapter 1. Given the wonkiness of the situation, I was unable to make Chapter 1 look pretty. Don't worry! I'll fix it tomorrow. I wanted to make sure you had all the links and content!
