^^ QUIZ - Plagiarism Agreement

# Description

This is our plagiarism agreement. Computer Science is a funny field from a copying standpoint:

* Many people and companies share their code publicly - and it's *free and legal* to use!

* It's easy to steal someone else's code and pass it off as your own.

* It's easy to convince yourself that you understand some code you've found online even if you haven't really digested it all.

But consider this - perhaps you are taking a poetry class and are tasked with submitting a sonnet. Sure, you could steal one of William Shakespeare's sonnets and submit it. That's legal (his work is not protected by copyright). 

But it's unethical.

And you've cheated your brain an opportunity to flourish.

And it's against the Student Code of Conduct.

I take plagiarism very seriously. If your code raises a flag (Mimir can - and will - do that automatically), you will receive one warning and an "F" for the assignment. Two plagiarism infractions result in ejection from this class with an irrevocable "F" for the class.

# Empathy Clause

Here's the thing that I've experienced the most. I don't think people ever want to plagiarize. I think typically what happens is people back themselves into a corner and run out of time to do work. Since there aren't very many opportunities to hand things in late, the only path forward might be cheating.

**If this is you**, email me. I'd rather generate options with you one-on-one then have you get an "F". Honestly, be open and transparent and we can work something out.

# Specifications

* Read each question carefully and initial or sign your name.

* You need to get a 100% on this before you can see the Orientation Quiz (which will then give you access to the rest of the course!); you may take this as many times as you'd like.
