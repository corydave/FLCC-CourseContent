We'll take a deep dive into the `Math` class, `Random` class, `Scanner` class, and `String` class. These are all really helpful classes in Java that will help you as we explore more and more of what we can do in Java.

There are a number of labs (and some projects, which are more comprehensive than labs). I recommend you do them in the order they are listed here - that'll help scaffold your experience and mastery.

# To Ponder

In the meantime, ponder what you think this code might do if the user types in `1`. What if the user types in `3`? What if the user types in `55`?

```java

System.out.println("Pick a number 1 through 3:"); int choice = scanner.nextInt();

if (choice == 1) {

  System.out.println("Your new name is Alice.");

} else if (choice == 2) {

  System.out.println("Your new name is Bob.");

} else {

  System.out.println("Your new name is Chuck.");

}

System.out.println("The length of " + name + " is " + name.length());

```
