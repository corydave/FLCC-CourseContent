^^ LAB - `Circles01`


## DESCRIPTION

Using the value `3.14` for π (pi), find the area of a circle with a radius that is provided by the user.  

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* File name: `Circles01.java`

* Use `3.14` as a value of π (pi)

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* The formula for computing the area of a circle is A = π • r<sup>2</sup>

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```

Radius:
10
AREA = 314.0

```

```

Radius:
7.1
AREA = 158.2874


```

```

Radius:
1.0
AREA = 3.14


```

## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. You will need to change the comments (for instance, your name and the date).
