^^ PROJECT - `RandomCompliment02`

## DESCRIPTION
This is an extension of `RandomCompliment` - instead of a hardcoded compliment bank, this program will ask the user how many compliments should be in the bank and then prompt them to enter each compliment. They will be stored in an array.

In the next phase of the program, the user will be prompted to enter how many compliments they would like to receive ("0" to quit). Randomly, the software will dole out that many compliments. 

The compliment phase goes on until the user decides to quit.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the sample output exactly.

* The code to complete the task should be in a separate method that is called by the `main` method.

* Declare a `Random` object once in your method and pass it into your method that doles out the compliments.

* The method that doles out compliments should also take an `int` - the number of compliments.
