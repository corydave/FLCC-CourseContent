^^ FLIP - Chapter #5 Reflection

Please take this opportunity to reflect on the week. Reflection is a form of *metacognition* (that means thinking bout your thinking). These small exercises have been shown to improve thinking and learning. 

Here is the prompt for this week:

^=^ ,

This is the first time we've peaked into *decisions* (by the way - that's the distinction between a calculator and a computer; the ability to make decisions).

* Was there anything tricky about `if` statements?

* How might we make `if` statements better (spoiler alert - we'll be looking at more functionality in the future!).
