Malware has always been an issue (as early as the 1970s when ARPANET first arrived on the scene) for the security minded. Unfortunately, it's a bigger issue today with the sophistication of malware (like ransomware), the assets that need to be protected (more and more personal information is being stored), and the distribution of data centers (making attack vectors even bigger). This unit will explore some of the different types of malware out there today and suggest ways to mitigate exposure.
