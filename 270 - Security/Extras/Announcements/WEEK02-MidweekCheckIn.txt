^^ WEEK 02 - Midweek Check In

Hey folks! The week is about half over and hopefully you've had some time to check out the experiences in this chapter. A few things to gnaw on:

1. The most technical lab of this semester is getting Linux installed. If you are having issues, *please let me know*. It's smooth sailing after this lab.

2. Please make sure you read the instructions *carefully* for the LinkedIn assignment. Depending on your LinkedIn settings, you may be able to see these three posts which are stellar examples of what you should be writing:
