^^ WEEK 11 - Midweek Check In

^= =

# How's it going?
I haven't heard any questions from you this week. I hope this departure from the norm has been okay for you. The next chapter, Chapter 10, is the last chapter in the class. After that it's just the InfoSec report and the final exam!

Chapter 10 was written by my twin brother who is a software engineer and adjunct professor here and at RIT. Keep your eyes peeled for the new chapter!
