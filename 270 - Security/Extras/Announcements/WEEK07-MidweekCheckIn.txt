^^ WEEK 07 - Midweek Check In

Just a quick note to say I'm thinking of you and hope you are doing well. Don't forget work for this chapter is due Monday at noon. You *do* have the automatic two week grace period if you need it!

Don't forget that Spring Break is coming up!

Some of you have been searching for bugs in the course (typos, inaccurate quiz questions) and I really appreciate it!

Keep up the great work!
