# Hi!

Just a quick note to say, "HI!".

I hope you are having fun with the InfoSec assignment. I have only heard from a few students, so please remember that you need to bounce your idea off me!

# Final

The Final Exam will be opening later today!!!!!

# Late work

Please remember that the semester ends May 17 - that means you *need to have all your work in by noon that day*.
