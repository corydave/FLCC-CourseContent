^^ WEEK 12 - Weekly Introduction

^= =

# What's going on this week
This is it! The last chapter in the textbook! It's also a new chapter - Secure Software Design. It was written by John Ghidiu (my twin brother!). He's a software engineer and knows a thing or two about design.

The labs in this unit are pretty slick - make sure you go through them carefully and understand exactly what is due. Everybody needs to do the first three

* LAB - Install Java 15 (or Greater)
* LAB - Install WebGoat
* LAB - Broken Authentication - Password Reset

But then you get to choose. You can do the client-side labs:

* Bypass Front-End Restrictions
* Client Side Filtering
* HTML Tampering [20-40 minutes]

You can do the SQL Injection lab:

* SQL Injection

# Grades
I know there is still some work to grade, don't panic! I'm working on it now. You should see some movement in the grade book this week. I appreciate your patience.

# Next week
The last assignment in this class is the InfoSec report. It isn't due until May 9 so you should certainly spend time between 4/25 and 5/2 working on it. Be sure to scope out work from previous semesters so you have an idea of what to expect.
