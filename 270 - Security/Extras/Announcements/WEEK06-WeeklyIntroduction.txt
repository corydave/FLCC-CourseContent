^^ WEEK 06 - Weekly Introduction

# What to expect this week

We'll be looking at ways **you** can stay safer online. You *always* have to be on the lookout. Trust no one. Everyone is out to get you. Be paranoid. 

The experiences in this chapter are designed to equip you with tools to help you be aware of the threats and mitigate the threats.

# One thing to look out for
In the *Fiddling with DNS* lab, oftentimes students change the **`hosts`** file but the DNS doesn't change; make sure you:
1. Wait a few seconds before attempting to access the website
2. Use the text-based browser from the Linux prompt because sometimes full-blown browsers don't necessarily consult the **`hosts`** file.
