^^ WEEK 11 - Weekly Introduction

# Laker Day
I hope you had a good Laker Day and took advantage of some of the offerings at the college (including TACOS!). Laker Day is always a good opportunity to recharge - please make sure that if you missed it this week you plan to attend next week).

# THE LAW
This chapter is radically different than your previous chapters. In this chapter, the chapter reading is *incomplete*. Actually, it's just a framework. Your job is to go through the headings and *research*. You'll need to describe the different organizations, look at some laws, and research some of the big names in the domain.

Also, your lab experience will be to provide a "brief" regarding a recent article (the article was chosen by me for you!).
