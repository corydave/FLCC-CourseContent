# Staying safe at home
Hey! Hey you! You got any of those internet of things things? What about routers? You got any of those? 

Almost everyone has a router. Ever think about that? It's a complex piece of electronics that stays on 24/7. It is CONSTANTLY barraged with millions of packets (some of them malicious). Routers do way more than route traffic - they protect you. But with all the botnets out there, you can be confident that there are bots just waiting to get into your router and IoT devices.

When was the last time you updated your router? Do you even know if your router auto-updates? Do you know if you have any exposed ports? There are a *lot* of vulnerabilities that people often don't consider ("Oh, I'll just put a password on my router and I'm protected!").

Happily, mesh networks and modern routers go a long way in protecting your network, but you should still audit their security. 

This chapter looks at a few ways to do that.

# What to look out for
* The IoT Lab only asks for *one* of two labs; you get to pick which one!

* Be on the lookout for something "malicious" (it's safely malicious) in the Wireshark lab.
