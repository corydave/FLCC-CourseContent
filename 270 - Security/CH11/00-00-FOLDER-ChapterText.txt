There is a book called The Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage, and Fear in the Cyber Age. Every chapter chronicles (in painstakingly accurate details) a major cybersecurity breach (including Olympic Games, Stuxnet, and the DNC Email Hack). The book is both a technical and geo-political examination of how devastating these hacks are. You are certainly not responsible for reading this book (but it's a solid read and after this class you will hopefully want to read about just how insidious--and maybe avoidable--these attacks were.

For this assignment, you will be writing a chapter for a similar book! We will all pick a hack, research it, and write a paper. We'll have to be careful with citations, make sure we do a solid job writing, and even edit each others work. By the end of the semester, we'll have a book that is made up of all the papers we have written. It will be available for download for you and all your loved ones. It will also make a great birthday present for people you care about. If you have any questions, let me know!
