Remember when [fitness tracking app Strava gives away location of secret US army bases](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/fitness-tracking-app-gives-away-location-of-secret-us-army-bases) or when [Venmo was used to locate drug dealers](https://mashable.com/article/come-on-really)? All because software developers had the default sharing setting as "public". Or how about that time the [Australian Prime Minister posted his boarding pass online and was hacked](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21516842/tony-abbott-passport-boarding-pass-instagram-hacking-cybersecurity) or that time [teachers in Missouri had their social security numbers posted online](https://www.zdnet.com/article/missouri-apologizes-to-600k-teachers-who-had-ssns-and-private-info-exposed-offers-credit-monitoring/)? All because the software engineers were lazy with what information they were serving to browsers.

Yeah, we're gonna look at how to be smart from the ground up.
