^^ LAB - `KickStarter`

## DESCRIPTION
This program replicates the popular website [KickStarter.com](https://www.kickstarter.com/). Specifically, the project being considered is a tabletop game called "[The Cones of Dunshire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwmvsHtoLgU)". The funding follows the following model:

* $1 - A "Thank You" email
* $5 - Your name will be put on the website
* $20 - You will receive a version of the mobile app
* $50 - You will receive a copy of the tabletop version
* $100 - You will receive the Founders Edition version
* $150 - You will receive a hat

The way that this KickStarter is configured will award all backers with all the rewards at the lower levels, too. For instance, if someone contributes $5, they will receive both the name on their website (the reward for a $5 backing) as well as the email. 

If a backer contributes $100, then they will receive the rewards for the $100 level, the $50 level, the $20 level, the $5 level, and the $1 level.

NOTE: Your solution MUST use a switch statement to receive full credit. Refer to ยง6.3 in your textbook for details on how to use a switch statement.
