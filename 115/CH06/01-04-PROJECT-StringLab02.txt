^^ PROJECT - `StringLab02`

## DESCRIPTION
`String`s in Java are important - oftentimes capturing user input involves using a `String`. For us, a `String` is one of our first exposures to classes and objects in Java. Unlike primitive data types which just hold data, objects can perform different tasks with the data they hold. For instance, a `String` can convert itself to all uppercase (or lowercase).

```java
String name = "Dave";
System.out.println(name.toUpperCase());    // DAVE
```

It can also trim all the leading and trailing whitespace from itself. It can report its length (number of characters). 

```java
String name = " Dave ";
System.out.println(name.trim());           // Dave
System.out.println(name.length());         // 6
System.out.println(name.trim().length());  // 4
```

It can even see if specific characters are contained in it. 

```java
String name = "Dave";
System.out.println(name.indexOf('a'));     // 1
// Don't forget that Strings are zero-indexed!
```
<br />

There are many things that a String can do - check out the [Relevant API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gkG_LhtL31_BIHHZ-e5C-Ug5z1t6qp4R1XNCNuIk-0c/edit?usp=sharing) for more functionality, as well as [Section 4.3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-FmWZFelbIoXxZuQifn5Xv1CceJwMijJnf7A3rjghOI/edit?usp=sharing) in the textbook.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output should be similar to the Sample Output, but you have creative freedom for the rewards. The last line, `Thanks for backing 'Cones of Dunshire'.` needs to be verbatim.

* The code to complete the task should be in a separate method that is called by the `main` method

* Your solution must use a `switch` statement to receive full credit.
