^^ CHAPTER 6 - Complex Selection

## Experiences for this chapter

This chapter we will look at a few different, sophisticated if statements.
* `if-else` statements have a few different options (off-ramps)

* `switch` statements

* Using `&&` or `||` to evaluate multiple components at the same time

```java

int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int c = 30;
int d = 40;

if ( (a > b) || (c > b) ) {
  System.out.println("Victory!");
}

```

In the meantime, why do you think the `Scanner` is created in `main`?

```java

public static void main (String[] args) {
  Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
  displayMenu(scanner);
}

public static int displayMenu(scanner) {
  ... some code here ...
}

```
