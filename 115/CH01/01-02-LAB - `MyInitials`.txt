^^ LAB - `MyInitials`

# DESCRIPTION

Write a program that outputs your initials using precisely **6 lines** of output.

<br />

# SPECIFICATIONS

* File name: `MyInitials.java`
* The code to print the initials should be in a separate method that is called by the `main` method.
* Work will not be assessed on the quality of the artwork üòù.

^=^ ,

## NOTE:

Since the output will vary by student, this program will be graded manually; CodeGrade will merely check to see if there are six lines of output and I will look at each submission.

^=

<br />

# SAMPLE OUTPUT

*The first sample output is for a student who has the initials "T J" and the second sample output is for a student who has the initials "D G".*
