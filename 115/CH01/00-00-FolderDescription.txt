^^ CHAPTER 01 - Introduction

This chapter is an examination of the tools you need to get started programming. We'll look at a few different IDEs (integrated development environments - the software you'll use to program!), CodeGrade (the software you'll use to see if your code works!), and some other tidbits about Java.

# To ponder

```java

System.out.println("Bart Simpson");	

```
