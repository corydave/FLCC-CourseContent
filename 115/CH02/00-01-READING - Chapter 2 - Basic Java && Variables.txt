The reading for this chapter is [Chapter 2 - Basic Java && Variables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nm77I53jfP5z9896pFOrjAcSjPR62l9G0O3U8Yo8JTw/). There are some really neat things here (and maddening things, too, especially when we look at output). Knowing how to use a *variable* (and naming it appropriately) is going to be mission critical to learning how to program.

We start at the basics - *primitive data types*. These are the building blocks for programming almost anything. You'll always need somewhere to store values. For instance, when you enter your character's name into a game (or store your hit points, or store your avatar). You need a place to *store* the items so they can be recalled later (and modified).

<div style="clear:both;">

We'll be looking at different variable types:

* `int` for integers (positive and negative whole numbers)

* `double` for decimals (positive and negative)

* `char` for characters (any letter, number, or special character - including many emoji!)

* `boolean` for things that can be true or false
