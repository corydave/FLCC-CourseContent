^^ LAB - `ConvertCF01`


# DESCRIPTION

Write a program that will get a whole number from the user that represents a temperature in Celsius. Convert the temperature to Fahrenheit. Output the result in the exact format shown below. 

<br /> 

# SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* The starter code contains the code to get a number from the user. Don't worry about how this works yet - coming soon!

* The filename for this program is `ConvertCF01.java`

* Complete the `main` method to compute and output the converted temperature as shown below.

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* The formula for converting from Celsius to Fahrenheit is C * <sup>9</sup>/<sub>5</sub> + 32, though you might find you will run into errors if you use division with integers.

<br /> 

# SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
Enter a temperature in Celsius:
100
100 degrees Celsius is 212.0 degrees Fahrenheit.
```

```
Enter a temperature in Celsius:
-40
-40 degrees Celsius is -40.0 degrees Fahrenheit.
```

```
Enter a temperature in Celsius:
1
1 degrees Celsius is 33.8 degrees Fahrenheit.
```

## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. You will need to change the comments (for instance, your name and the date).
