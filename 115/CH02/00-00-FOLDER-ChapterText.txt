^^ CHAPTER 02 - Basic Java && Variables

# Experiences for this chapter

^= =

We're going to look at some basic Java building blocks (primitive data types like int, char, double, and boolean). We'll also consider some basic mathematical operations and then we'll conclude with a fairly in-depth look at ```System.out.println()``` statements.

In the meantime, ponder what you think this code might do:

```java
int num1 = 10;
int num2 = 4;

System.out.print(num2 + " goes into " + num1);
System.out.print(num1/num2 + " times with a remainder of ");
System.out.print(num1%num2 + ".");
```
