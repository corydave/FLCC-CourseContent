^^ LAB - `RandomNumbers02`


## DESCRIPTION

Ask the user for a seed that you will use to seed the random number generator. Using the `Random` class, generate two random numbers. The first number is unbounded. The second number should be within the range of 1 to 100 (inclusive of both).

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* File name: `RandomNumbers02.java`

* Your output must match the sample output *exactly*.

* The code to complete the task should be in a separate method that is called by the `main` method

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top!


## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
Please enter a seed for the RNG:
33
Random number = -1168181290
Random, bounded number = 20
```

```
Please enter a seed for the RNG:
88
Random number = -1177030515
Random, bounded number = 56
```

```
Please enter a seed for the RNG:
101
Random number = -1194344215
Random, bounded number = 91
```

```
Please enter a seed for the RNG:
987654321
Random number = 1314001072
Random, bounded number = 28
```

## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. You will need to change the comments (for instance, your name and the date).
