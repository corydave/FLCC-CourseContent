^^ LAB - `RandomChars`


## DESCRIPTION

Write a program that asks the user for an `int` and uses it as a seed for the random number generator (`Random` class). The program should then randomly generate:
* an uppercase letter
* a lowercase letter
* a digit between 0 and 9


## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* File name: `RandomChars.java`

* Your output must match the sample output *exactly*

* The code to complete the task should be in a separate method that is called by the main method

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Use the [ASCII table](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html) to determine numeric ranges

    * This is true for the digits 0-9 as well - don't use `int`s - use `char`s

* Hint- the general format for generating a random number in a range is:

```java ^copy
rand.nextInt(<numberOfOptions>) + <lowestValue>;

// where <numberOfOptions> is the range of values (max - min + 1)
// and <lowestValue> is the lowest possible number 
```

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
Enter a seed for the random number generator:
0
RANDOM:
Uppercase = S
Lowercase = s
Digit = 9
```

```
Enter a seed for the random number generator:
10
RANDOM:
Uppercase = P
Lowercase = g
Digit = 3
```

```
Enter a seed for the random number generator:
33
RANDOM:
Uppercase = D
Lowercase = z
Digit = 3
```

```
Enter a seed for the random number generator:
88
RANDOM:
Uppercase = S
Lowercase = t
Digit = 9
```

## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. You will need to change the comments (for instance, your name and the date).
