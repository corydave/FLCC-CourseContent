^^ LAB - `RandomNumbers01`


## DESCRIPTION

This lab will examine the `Math.random()` method and the `Random` class. There are four phases to this program.

1. Generate a random number using the `Math` class
2. Generate a random number using the `Math` class, but manipulating the number to be between 1 and 10
3. Generate a random number using the `Random` class (unseeded)
4. Generate a random number using the `Random` class (unseeded) that is between 1 and 10


## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* File name: `RandomNumbers01.java`

* Your output will probably not match the sample output exactly; after all, there is randomness involved

* There should be two method calls in the `main` method
    * `MathClass()` will handle phases 1 and 2
    * `RandomClass()` will handle phases 3 and 4

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* The code for this assignment will be inspected manually by me.

```java ^copy
rand.nextInt(<numberOfOptions>) + <lowestValue>;

// where <numberOfOptions> is the range of values (max - min + 1)
// and <lowestValue> is the lowest possible number 
```

## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. You will need to change the comments (for instance, your name and the date).
