^^ PROJECT - `SaltPassword`

## BACKGROUND

In the realm of cybersecurity, there is the notion of *salting* a password. This is meant to help secure your password. Imagine that your password is **`abc123`** (which is literally one of the most popular passwords). Since it is easy to crack, some software will add some random characters to the end of your password after you type it in. For instance, the algorithm may generate **`3@]6`**, so your new password is really **`abc1233@]6`**. Don't worry - you don't need to remember this extra part; the software will manage the salted password for you! 

## DESCRIPTION

Write a program that asks the user for an int and uses it as a seed for the random number generator. Then the program should ask the user for a password. The program should then randomly generate a salt of five characters and append it to the password.


## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* File name: `SaltPassword.java`

* Your output should match the sample output exactly.

* The code to complete the task should be in a separate method that is called by the `main` method

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Use the [ASCII table](https://www.asciitable.com/index/asciifull.gif) to determine numeric ranges (capital "A" to lowercase "z" - note that this range will also include some symbols that reside between the set of capital letters and the set of lowercase letters).

* **HINT -** The general format for generating a random number in a range is

<div style="width:80%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">

<center>

```
rand.nextInt(<numberOfOptions>) + <lowestValue>
```
</center>

where `<numberOfOptions>` is the range of values (max - min + 1)
and `<lowestValue>` is the lowest possible number 

</div>


## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
Enter seed:
33

Enter a password:
password

Salt: nnfNk
Salted password: passwordnnfNk
```

<br />

```
Enter seed:
22

Enter a password:
123456

Salt: YiEZB
Salted password: 123456YiEZB
```

<br />

```
Enter seed:
-100

Enter a password:
nevergonnagiveyouup

Salt: M`\]r
Salted password: nevergonnagiveyouupM`\]r
```

## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. You will need to change the comments (for instance, your name and the date).
