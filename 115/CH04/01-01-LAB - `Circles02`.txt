^^ LAB - `Circles02`


## DESCRIPTION

Using the built-in `Math.PI` constant, find the circumference and area of a circle with a radius that is provided by the user. Also provide the rounded approximation of the area (to the nearest integer). Note: this is NOT truncating.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* File name: `Circles01.java`

* Use `Math.PI` as a value of π (pi)

* Your output must match the sample output exactly (last few digits may differ, reg. ex. used)

* The code to complete the task should be in a separate method that is called by the main method

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* The formula for computing the area of a circle is &nbsp;&nbsp; **A = π • r<sup>2</sup>**

* The formula for computing the circumference of a circle is &nbsp;&nbsp; **C = 2 • π • d**

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
Radius:
10
CIRCUMFERENCE = 62.83185307179586
AREA = 314.1592653589793
ROUNDED AREA = 314
```

```
Radius:
5.9
CIRCUMFERENCE = 37.07079331235956
AREA = 109.35884027146072
ROUNDED AREA = 109
```

```
Radius:
6.1
CIRCUMFERENCE = 38.32743037379547
AREA = 116.89866264007618
ROUNDED AREA = 117
```

## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. You will need to change the comments (for instance, your name and the date).
