^^ LAB - `Taxes`

## DESCRIPTION
Write a program that asks the user to enter their yearly income. The program should display the user's income bracket according to the following guidelines:

* Income below $50,000: Income Bracket 1

* Income of $50,000 - $99,999.99: Income Bracket 2

* Income of $100,000 or above: Income Bracket 3

The program should then output the amount of federal taxes they will have to pay given that the Federal Tax Rate is 15% (for all income brackets).

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the sample output exactly. 

* To receive full credit, your code must contain multiple methods that complete the major steps of the program. Each method should be focused on a singular task, and have a comment that gives a description of what the method does. Also include comments in your main method.

* The amount of taxes owed must be rounded to the nearest cent.

### NOTE 

Rounding hint (refer to section 3.5 in the textbook for more details):

Multiply by 100, round, divide by 100.0:

`double taxes = taxes * 100;
taxes = Math.round(taxes) / 100.0;`

</center>
