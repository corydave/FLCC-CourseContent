^^ LAB - `Circles03`

## DESCRIPTION
Using the built-in `Math.PI` constant, find the circumference and area of a circle with a radius that is provided by the user. Also provide the rounded approximation of the area (to the nearest integer). Note: this is NOT truncating. 

This will be an updated version of our earlier `Circles` lab - make it better by using more methods!

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the sample output exactly (last few digits may differ, reg. ex. used) 

* The code to complete the task should be in a separate method that is called by the `main` method

* To receive full credit, your code must contain methods for each major step in the program. Each calculation should be done in its own non-`void` method, and a method should be used to display the final results.

* Using the `Scanner` to read keyboard input from the user can be done in the `main` method.

* Be sure to start every method with a comment that includes a description of what the method does/returns! Also include comments throughout your `main` method.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
Radius:
10
CIRCUMFERENCE = 62.83185307179586
AREA = 314.1592653589793
ROUNDED AREA = 314
```

<br />

```
Radius:
5.9
CIRCUMFERENCE = 37.07079331235956
AREA = 109.35884027146072
ROUNDED AREA = 109
```

<br />

```
Radius:
6.1
CIRCUMFERENCE = 38.32743037379547
AREA = 116.89866264007618
ROUNDED AREA = 117
