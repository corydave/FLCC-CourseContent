^^ PREVIEW WEEK

Hey folks! Welcome to Preview Week! 

You have a secret, VIP backstage pass to CS1: Introduction to Programming with Java. The course will open on Thursday, May 25 - but until then, please cruise around the course and get a feel for it. Here's a few things to know:

* Read the Course Outline (Syllabus)! At least read the first half of it; the second half is generic to FLCC and you've probably seen it before.

* *Especially* read the part about ChatGPT.

* The textbook for this course is free and is offered as a PDF; you do not need to buy a book.

* You *will* need access to **CodeGrade** as that is where you will be submitting your work.

I look forward to meeting you!
