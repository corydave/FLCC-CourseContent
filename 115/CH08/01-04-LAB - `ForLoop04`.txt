^^ LAB - `ForLoop04`

## DESCRIPTION
Using a `for` loop, write a small program that asks the user for a beginning number, an ending number, and an incrementor. The program then outputs a list of numbers starting at the beginning number and increasing by the incrementor. The loop stops when the numbers meet or exceed the end value. Consult the **Sample Output** for specific formatting.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the sample output exactly.

* The code to complete the task should be in a separate method that is called by the `main` method
