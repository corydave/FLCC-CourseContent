^^ PROJECT - `RandomCompliment`

## DESCRIPTION
Construct a program that iterates until the user presses `0`. If the number is greater than zero, then the software will dole out that number of compliments.

Hint: It is probably easiest to accomplish this by creating a `while` loop to govern the entire program and a `for` loop to dole out the compliments. It is also probably easier to create a small method first - one that just doles out random compliments (based on the input from the user). The next step is to wrap that program in a `while` loop.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output must match the sample output exactly.

* The code to complete the task should be in a separate method that is called by the `main` method.

* Declare a `Random` object once in your method and pass it into your method that doles out the compliments.

* The method that doles out compliments should also take an `int` - the number of compliments.

* The method that provides the compliments should also use a `switch` statement (cases 0 through 2) to pick one compliment from a bank of 3.
