^^ CHAPTER 5 - Introduction to Selections

Let's look at if statements. That is, statements that make a decision (based on the state of a variable, for instance) and acts one way if the test passes and another way if the test does not pass. Here's some code that essentially flips a coin and provides different actions based on the result:

```java

// Recall that Math.random() returns a number between 0.0 and 0.99999...
if (Math.random() > 0.5) {

  System.out.println("You may pass");

} else {

  System.out.println("NONE SHALL PASS!");

}

```

# To ponder

You'll need to draw on your knowledge of `String`, `Math`, `Scanner`, `Random`, variables, and `if-else` statements.

In the meantime, can you conjecture what the output will be if the user types in `10`?

```java ^copy

// Instatntiate a new Scanner
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    
// Prompt the user for a number (age of a student) and then store it in 'age'
System.out.println("Enter the age of your child:");
int age = scanner.nextInt();
    
// Declare 'school' to hold the resulting String
String school = "";

// Logic to determine which school the child will go to
if (age > 0 && age < 5) {
  school = "Pre-K";
} else if (age >= 5 && age < 12) {
  school = "Elementary school";
} else if (age >=12 && age < 15) {
  school = "Middle school";
} else {
  school = "High school";
}    
    
// Output to user
System.out.println("The school is: " + school);

```
