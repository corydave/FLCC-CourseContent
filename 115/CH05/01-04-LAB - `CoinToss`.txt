^^ LAB - `CoinToss`

## DESCRIPTION

In this program the computer simulates flipping a coin ("H" is heads and "T" is tails). The user guesses what the computer got, and the computer reports if they guessed correctly or not. 

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* File name: `CoinToss.java`

* The code to complete the task should be in a separate method that is called by the `main` method

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Output should match the Sample Output exactly.

* To generate a HEADS or TAILS, do the following:
    * Seed the `Random` object
    * Generate a random integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive of 9)
    * If the number is less than five, consider the flip a HEADS; otherwise it's a TAILS

* Complete the given method by prompting the user for a guess. Then display what the computer got and print a message specifying if the user guessed correctly or not. You will have to create a Scanner object to read input from the keyboard.

* You will need to consider "h" and "H" as HEADS and "t" as well as "T" as tails.



## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
Enter a seed:
33
 
What is your guess (H or T)?
H
The computer got H.
You guessed right!
```
<br />
