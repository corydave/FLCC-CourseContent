^^ LAB - `Compliment02`


## DESCRIPTION

This program will dole out a compliment if the user wants one. There will be either 1 or 2 lines of output, depending on what the user chooses.
* Ask the user if they want a compliment.
* If the user indicates that they want a compliment, print one.
* Output "Game Over" at the end (regardless of if they wanted a compliment or not).



**NOTE:** You may assume that the user will only press "1" or "2".

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* File name: `Compliment02.java`

* The code to complete the task should be in a separate method that is called by the `main` method

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* The only line of output that needs to match exactly is the last line. You have creative control for the other lines- make up your own compliment! :)

## SAMPLE OUTPUT
