^^ LAB - `ConvertCF02`


## DESCRIPTION

The user inputs a value (in degrees Celsius) and the computer outputs the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
The formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is: F = 9/5C + 32.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* File name: `ConvertCTF02.java`

* The code to complete the task should be in a separate method that is called by the `main` method

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top!

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```
Temperature:
100
In Fahrenheit, the temperature is 212.0 
```

```
Temperature:
36.99999
In Fahrenheit, the temperature is 98.599982
```

```
Temperature:
0
In Fahrenheit, the temperature is 32.0
```

```
Temperature:
-40
In Fahrenheit, the temperature is -40.0
```
