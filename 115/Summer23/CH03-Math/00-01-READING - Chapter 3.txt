The reading for this chapter is [Chapter 3 - Math](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yCS7eqh9uWHzliIbqoKRV_Z4I7pZ2kv8WR6rOMINaoY/edit). Don't panic - there is not a ton of math you need to know to gain an appreciation of programming. But you might need to brush off some of your math neurons and practice with some of the fundamentals.

But there are some wonky things in Java (and many other computer programming languages. For instance, there is a *huge* difference when dealing with integers (whole numbers) and decimals. And the order of operations is a bit more precise. And there is the  mysterious fifth operator (you know +, -, /, and *, but do you know what % means?). Oh yeah, and there is the notion of *casting*. This chapter will catch you up to speed with Java's spin on math.

As you are reading, please make sure you leave comments in the margins (you can highlight text in the document and leave a comment). Perhaps you notice a typo. Maybe you have something to add. Or maybe you just want to add a question that someone else can answer for you.
