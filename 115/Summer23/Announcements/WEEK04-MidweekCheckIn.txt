^^ WEEK 4 - Midweek Check In

# New chapter
Chapter 4 is BIG. There is A LOT to do. I hope you took advantage of the early start. Again, I would like to reiterate that the best way to work through Java is to do a bit each day. If you only sit down to work with Java once a week, you probably won't grasp everything nearly as easily.

# Grades
I wanted to have everything graded by Monday, but I couldn't ðŸ˜”. I'll have it all done by Saturday morning *at the absolute latest*. Thanks for your patience!
