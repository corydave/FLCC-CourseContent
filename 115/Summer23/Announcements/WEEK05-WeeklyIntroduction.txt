^^ WEEK 5 - Weekly Introduction

# Welcome to week 5!

A few things, folks:

* Chapter five has been posted - it is a look into `if-then` statements (decisions).

* There is a new feature in Blackboard - a place where you can experiment with code! Try it out and let me know what you think!

* A few of you reached out and let me know that the link for the Chapter 5 reading was wrong. I've fixed it! Thank you for letting me know!
