^^ WEEK 3 - Midweek Check In

# Weekend!
Hey folks! I've started grading the work that has been submitted and expect to have all of it done by Monday. One quick thing - the Chapter 4 Reading Guide was configured improperly so it wasn't accessible. Two students alerted me on Friday afternoon and it's been fixed! Remember there is a bug bounty program in this course!

I hope all is going well and if you have any questions, please let me know. I will be in and out of internet access for the next two days ðŸ™‚.
