The reading for this chapter is [Chapter 9 - Arrays](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Mb6XFR26TXlqP_No8FVszjdAfOuCW476_7O5f3SEwA/edit). 

We'll be looking at *arrays* in this chapter. An array is one variable that can hold multiple values at once. Think of it as a file cabinet drawer - each hanging folder can hold one item, and you can reference them by name ("The third folder from the front has the file I'm looking for - can you pull it for me?").

As you are reading, please make sure you leave comments in the margins (you can highlight text in the document and leave a comment). Perhaps you notice a typo. Maybe you have something to add. Or maybe you just want to add a question that someone else can answer for you.
