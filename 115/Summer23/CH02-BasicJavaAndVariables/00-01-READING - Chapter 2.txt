The reading for this chapter is [Chapter 2 - Basic Java && Variables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nm77I53jfP5z9896pFOrjAcSjPR62l9G0O3U8Yo8JTw/edit). This chapter covers **important fundamentals** that are necessary for *everything you will do* for the rest of the semester. We'll look at variables (data types), errors, comments, and some sweet, sweet other Java things.

As you are reading, please make sure you leave comments in the margins (you can highlight text in the document and leave a comment). Perhaps you notice a typo. Maybe you have something to add. Or maybe you just want to add a question that someone else can answer for you.
