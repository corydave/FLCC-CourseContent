^^ LAB - `BoxOfDonuts`


## DESCRIPTION

Everybody knows that a box of donuts holds 12 donuts<sup>1</sup>. In the Computer Sciencery Bakery, donuts are exclusively boxed by the dozen. If someone orders a number that is not a multiple of 12 then the remaining donuts will be placed in a bag. In this exploration, you will be given a number of donuts. Your job is to report how many boxes will be needed and how many donuts will go in a bag (if needed). 

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* File name: `BoxOfDonuts.java`

* Grammar is suspended for this exercise (for instance, it is permissible to say “1 donuts will go into a bag”.

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Answer the reflection questions at the end of the lab.
_____
<font size="-1"><sup>1</sup> This isn’t really true anymore since donuts have become bigger and more specialized. I mean, some places still have 12 donuts in a box (like Krispy Kreme and Dunkin' Donuts, but they have to literally redesign the donut box!</font>
