^^ LAB - `MathFunctions`


## DESCRIPTION

There are *tons* of math functions built in to Java. We'll learn about some of them in a later    part of the class, but today we are focusing on the big five:

1. Addition (`+`)
2. Subtraction (`-`)
3. Multiplication (`*`)
4. Division (`/`)
5. Modulo (`%`)

The program should ask the user for two numbers (integers) and then display the results.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab. No need to worry about how to get the numbers from the user; that has already been taken care of in the starter code. You just need to concern yourself with the math and the output.

* File name: `MathFunctions.java`

* Add comments with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Answer the reflection questions at the end of the lab.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```

Enter a number:
1
Enter another number:
3

Sum of 1 and 3: 4
Difference of 1 and 3: -2
Product of 1 and 3: 3
Quotient of 1 and 3: 0
Modulo of 1 and 3: 1

```

```

Enter a number:
14
Enter another number:
5

Sum of 14 and 5: 19
Difference of 14 and 5: 9
Product of 14 and 5: 70
Quotient of 14 and 5: 2
Modulo of 14 and 5: 4

```

```

Enter a number:
1
Enter another number:
1

Sum of 1 and 1: 2
Difference of 1 and 1: 0
Product of 1 and 1: 1
Quotient of 1 and 1: 1
Modulo of 1 and 1: 0

```

```

Enter a number:
100
Enter another number:
10

Sum of 100 and 10: 110
Difference of 100 and 10: 90
Product of 100 and 10: 1000
Quotient of 100 and 10: 10
Modulo of 100 and 10: 0

```

## STARTER CODE

You may use the following code as starter code. You will need to change the comments (for instance, your name and the date).
