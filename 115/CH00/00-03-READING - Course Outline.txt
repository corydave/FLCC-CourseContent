I'm excited about this semester - it's awesome that you've decided to take this class. Learning how to program can be a bit disorienting at first. In my experience, it takes a bit longer to catch on in this class (compared to other classes). 

The most important ingredient you can have when programming is *perseverance*. Stick with it. Ask questions. Probe. Telescope. Look stuff up. Go to YouTube. But *stay in touch with me if you are struggling!!!!*. 

I'm excited. Please embrace this class. It's gonna be fun!
