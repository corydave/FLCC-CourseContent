^^ LAB - Plagiarism Agreement

Plagiarism is a blurry line in programming (many engineers give permission for anyone to use their code, for instance). While there are plenty of places where you can find code to satisfy the labs and the projects, you should not submit that code as your own. From a legal perspective there are no repercussions, but submitting work that is not your own is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct. It's also unethical. It's also not cool!

Tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot can generate most of the code you will need in this class. I haven't quite figured out the best way to use ChatGPT as a learning agent, so please work with me on this! 

If you find that you are relying on ChatGPT (or a similar tool), please keep the following in mind:

1. You *must* credit the tool in the comments of your code.

2. You *must* estimate what percentage of the code was generated by the tool.

3. Your grade will not be affected by reliance on these tools, but I do ask that you develop ways to use these tools to help you learn - not just as ways to get the labs and projects done.

I really, really, *really* want to start incorporating these tools into class moving forward. I would absolutely *love* to hear about your experience in this class if you decide to use artificial intelligence to help you.

You should read the Plagiarism Agreement carefully and make sure you understand everything in it.
