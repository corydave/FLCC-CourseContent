^^ LAB - `while_loop_guess`

## DESCRIPTION
Now it's time to really dig into the potency of the `while` loop. In this lab, we will have the user guess a number. They will keep guessing *until* they get the number.

The "secret number" in this exercise is 33 (and is hard-coded into the software as a constant).

## SPECIFICATIONS
