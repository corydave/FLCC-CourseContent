^^ LAB - `compliment2`

## DESCRIPTION
Building off of `compliment.py`, this program goes a step further and will have custom output for `yes` as well as not `yes` (see the Sample Output for more details).

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* The `if` statement should compare user input to the string `yes`. Any deviation from `yes` should default to the `No compliment for you!` message.


## SAMPLE OUTPUT
