^^ More Functions

Python has a really slick way you can use the code from one file inside another - by *importing* it.

It is super simple to do it but there are a few caveats for doing it well (we won't get into those just yet). An interesting way to look at this paradigm is to consider *utility* files.

Think of it this way - a calculator program might be broken up into two different files. One file that does all the dirty work (like adding, subtracting, etc.) and one file that is the front-end (the software that gets input from the user). One advantage of this is that multiple calculators can exist, each one with a different interface. But if they all use the *utility* file, all the complex stuff can be used from all the other calculator front-ends. 

### EXAMPLE CODE

Here are two files - one is a *driver* file with the `main()` function, and the other file has no `main()` and is just the *utility*:

^= =

```python

# FILE NAME - triangle.py

import triangle_util

def main():
    triangle()

def triangle():
    print('===== TRIANGLE INFO =====\n')
    triangle_util.area()

    print()

    triangle_util.perimeter()

main()




```

^===

```python

# FILE NAME - triangle_util.py

def area():
    base = float(input('Length of base: '))
    height= float(input('Lenth of height: '))
    
    area = base * height / 2
    
    print('\nAREA:', area)


def perimeter():
    side01 = float(input('Length of side 1: '))
    side02 = float(input('Length of side 2: '))
    side03 = float(input('Length of side 3: '))

    perimeter = side01 + side02 + side03

    print('\nPERIMETER:', perimeter)

```

^=

### EXAMPLE OUTPUT

```
===== TRIANGLE INFO =====

Length of base: 10
Lenth of height: 20

AREA: 100.0

Length of side 1: 3
Length of side 2: 4
Length of side 3: 5

PERIMETER: 12.0
```

There will be one long video and some labs for you to experiment with.
