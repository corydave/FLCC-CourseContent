Welcome to the *most awesome semester ever!* I mean, sure. This winter and spring there are sweet things to do. Trips to take. Sights to see. Mountains to ski. Fires to snuggle up to. Flowers to smell. 

But then there's a whole new level - this class. Python. Please make sure you check out the sweet, sweet video and Course Outline below.

There are also other files here that might help you navigate through the semester - so be sure to check them out. Things like Academic Support, an invitation to Discord,  a place to give me feedback, my Student Hours schedule, and some other cool things.
