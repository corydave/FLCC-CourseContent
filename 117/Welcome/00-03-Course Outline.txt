The reading for this chapter is the [Course Information Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C7GpbTqMnn7UTuHwSen1kHtIV47fS7oJqdHyHyu5KSo/preview) (also known as the Course Outline or Course Syllabus). Yeah, I know. It's boring. Like, real boring. I tried to jazz it up. It will make you laugh. It will make you cry. It might make you laugh again.




Here's the big takeaways:




<div style="margin-left:220px;">




* The late work policy is interesting. Please read it carefully.




* Work is due on Wednesdays at noon. Please make sure you plan accordingly.




* This is the first time this Python class is being offered. We will be learning Python through the lens of building a game. More on that later!




* I really, really, *really* am excited to be teaching Python. But I really would like your input as the semester is unfolding. **Please, give me your honest, open, candid feedback!** (that is discussed more in the Course Information Sheet).




* The first part of the Syllabus is specific to this class. The second part of the Syllabus contains elements you've probably seen before in other classes as they are relative to FLCC. You might want to read through this part, too, as the information may have changed.

# Specifications




* The Course Information Sheet (Course Outline, Course Syllabus) [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C7GpbTqMnn7UTuHwSen1kHtIV47fS7oJqdHyHyu5KSo/preview).




* Also watch the orientation video below; both the reading and the video set the stage for the wonkiness of this class.




* The information in the reading and video is important! There will be a quiz on it. Don't worry - it's open notes and you can take it as many times as you'd like.
