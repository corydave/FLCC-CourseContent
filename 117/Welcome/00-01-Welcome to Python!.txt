^^ Welcome to Portal!

A few things to know before getting started. This Welcome Tour will appear every time you enter this class - until you hit the "Dismiss" button in the bottom. Make sure you check out the video and the Course Outline so you know if this course is right for you.

## The "big things" to know about this course:

* **We're using Brightspace instead of Blackboard** - This is the first semester that we will be using Brightspace (we have been using Blackboard for the past several years). There will be some growing pains. If you find that something doesn't make sense in here or you can't find something, email me! There's a good chance I screwed something up üòÅ! But it is very important that if you have an issue, you reach out to me immediately. If there is anything giving you problems, I want to fix it!!!

* **This class is a beginner's course to Python** - We'll be building a simple game with Python this semester - hopefully it's a game you've never seen before (that makes it a bit more engaging). Along the way, we'll learn everything we need to know about Python to help with downstream programming in the Networking & Cybersecurity realm.

* **I'd love to meet you** - Please plan on scheduling a meeting with me via video chat. Don't do it now, but you will have the opportunity to schedule a meeting during one of the first chapters in this course.  Also, if you have questions, email me. Or video chat me. Or Discord me. Or whatever! We do have a Discord for the Computing Sciences department here at FLCC and you'll have the option of joining it once the class starts.
