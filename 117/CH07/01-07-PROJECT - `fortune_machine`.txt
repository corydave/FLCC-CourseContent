^^ PROJECT - `fortune_machine`

## DESCRIPTION
This project requires a comprehensive knowledge of everything we've explored so far in Python. We'll also be on the hook for providing some thought into the design of the program.

## WALKTHROUGH

The phases of the program are:
1. Welcome the user to the Fortune Telling Machine.

2. Ask them to load in fortunes. These fortunes will be dispensed randomly later.

3. The software will randomly pick a fortune and print it out. The user will choose if they want to get another fortune. This goes on until the user indicates that they are done.

4. Thank the user for playing the game and ask them to smash that like button.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab.

* Add a comment with your name, date, and program description at the top!

* Your output can look however you'd like it to; this lab will be assessed by hand.
