Hopefully the syllabus and orientation video in this chapter has helped you make sense of how the class work. So here's your first quiz!

You need to score an 80% or better on the quiz to see the rest of the content in the chapter.

Don't worry! You can take the quiz as many times as you'd like. But keep in mind that there is only a three-day grace period and after that you won't be able to take the quiz. So it's in your best interest to take the quizzes before the due date.

# Specifications

* The quiz has questions based on the Course Syllabus and the Welcome and Course Orientation video.

* The quiz is open book.

* You may take the quiz as many times as you'd like, but you need to score at least 80% to see the rest of the content in this chapter.
