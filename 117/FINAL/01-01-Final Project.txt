^^ Final Project

The final project in this class is a culminating attestation of your understanding of Python. You will design a piece of software that includes every topic we've covered:

* variables
* conditionals (`if` statements)
* loops
* lists

You will also have to submit your pre-planning (that could be a flowchart or pseudocode) for the program. The chapter Program Design has some video walkthroughs and planning videos to help you contextualize the process.

Ideas for programs include:
1. A checklist that lets the user create items and remove items
2. A game
3. A recipe book
4. Software that keeps track of stats (for instance a program that tracks baseball stats)

This program does *not* need to be a big endeavor, but it *does* need to be functional and it needs to cover the topics we looked at this semester.

If you want to meet with me you can let me know. Or you can run your idea by me via email. But you don't need to.

Good luck and have fun!
