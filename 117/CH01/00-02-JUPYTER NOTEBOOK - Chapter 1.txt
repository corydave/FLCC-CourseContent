^^ JUPYTER NOTEBOOK - Chapter 1

Jupyter Notebooks are digital files that you can load into your *IDE* (that stands for Integrated Development Environment, or where you code). They are interactive! They have text, videos, collapsible text, and - best of all - code that you can play with!

I think these notebooks are an awesome way to really dig into code. When you download these, you need to upload them into your IDE (in this case, we use [Google Cloud Shell ](https://shell.cloud.google.com/)) and run them. They are yours to keep. You can dork around with the code and experiment with Python!
