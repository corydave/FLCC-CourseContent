^^ Basic Output

If you have programmed in Java before, this small chapter will blow your mind (at the simplicity of Python). Consider this code from Java (to be clear, you are *not* responsible for any Java in this course):

```java
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

In Python, the code to do the *same thing* is:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

Yeah. That's it. It's that simple.

Since this is our first chapter with Python, there are still some things to get used to. In this chapter you'll find a video about understanding how each chapter works - including using *Jupyter Notebooks*. Then we'll look at how to submit work to CodeGrade. We'll also look at how ChatGPT can be super dumb sometimes. Then, it's off to the races - the Python Races. And by that I mean we'll just program. There's really no race.
