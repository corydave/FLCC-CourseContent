^^ Basic Output

If you have programmed in Java before, this small chapter will blow your mind (at the simplicity of Python). Consider this code from Java (to be clear, you are *not* responsible for any Java in this course):

```java
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

In Python, the code to do the *same thing* is:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

Yeah. That's it. It's that simple.
