^^ VIDEO - Virtual Machines

Normally I prefer to create videos for you (instead of including videos made by other people). But every once in a while I'll include a video that I have encountered. You should totally watch them when I share them.

Because they are awesome. Here's a good example:

^youtube <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SVQmzaSabEQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
