# Welcome

Hiya! Welcome to CSC-270: Principles of Information Security! This semester we'll be looking at all sorts of ways to keep information safe. We'll crack some passwords. Fake some tweets. Set up some honeypots. Encrypt messages. Decrypt messages. Learn about secure software design. Look at laws governing the sector.

This class has a lot of hands-on labs to help you gain experience with different facets of information security.

We'll also look at the theories and methodologies for securing information (the CIA model - not *that* CIA), RAID configurations, MFA, MTTR, and a host of other acronyms.

I'm stoked to work with you this semester, and you can get started right now! You should thoroughly dig into the Course Information section on the course menu to the left. Poke and prod in the Course Content section, too. That's where all the good stuff lives! Note that almost all the content is made available to you so you can work ahead.

If you have any questions, you can email me at dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu or hit me up on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5MYms7h).

# First things first

The best thing you can do to get started is go through Chapter 0. There are a lot of weirdo things I do in this class and Chapter 0 starts the calibration process.
