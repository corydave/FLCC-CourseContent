# TL;DR
* If you've had issues with Starfish and setting up an appointment, I've put in a ticket. Don't panic! It will get resolved.
* You can buy TestOut directly from the publisher - the Course Syllabus has been updated with information for that.
* Grades from TestOut will be transferred every week into Brightspace (but not the first week since some people are still getting into TestOut).

## Let's be careful out there!
