Do you know the difference between 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax? Do you know what WiFi 6 is? Have you ever poked around your router's web interface and checked out the settings? There is *a lot* to know about how to troubleshoot WiFi networks, configure the networks, and protect the networks.

It's also likely that your mobile device and your computer have multiple radios in them (cellular, WiFi, Bluetooth). And many phones have near field communication (NFC) as well (that's how Apple Pay and Google Pay work). 

Do you know what SOHO means (not the neighborhood in Manhattan)? or IoT?

We'll explore all this (and more!) in this chapter!

* 7.1 802.11 Wireless
* 7.2 Infrared, Bluetooth, and NFC
* 7.3 SOHO Configuration
* 7.4 Internet of Things
* 7.5 Wireless Network Troubleshooting
