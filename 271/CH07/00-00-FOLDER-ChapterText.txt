This part of the course has two chapters because the content is quite extensive. We will spend this chapter and the next chapter talking about *System Management*. If you haven't taken **CSC-231: Systems Administration** yet, this will be a good primer. I love this kind of stuff - being a SysAdmin is a bit stressful at times, but it really is interesting.

* 7.02: Windows Settings
