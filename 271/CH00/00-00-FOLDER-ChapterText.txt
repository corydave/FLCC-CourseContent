In this chapter, we will be acclimating to the class. There are a bunch of wonky things I do when teaching (like using Google Docs a lot, commenting on work, encouraging resubmitting work) that requires a bit of explanation. 

In this chapter, there are a few experiences where we will get to know each other. Then you'll learn how things operate in this class. Don't panic! It's not painful!
