Installing operating systems can be fun. It can also be time consuming. And it can be aggravating. But you know what makes it a bit more palatable? 

*Virtualization*. 

I find creating virtual machines to be *super fun and cool*. I know it sounds daunting, but it's not bad. And if you haven't installed virtualization software on your computer (I really like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) but I know some people prefer [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html)), you should totally get into it.

Spoiler alert - you'll *need to* for classes in the Networking & Cybersecurity program!

One of the reasons I have an affinity for virtualization is because it makes dorking around with high-stakes consequences  a safe move.
