Printers. You know them. You love them. You hate them. You don't see a need for them.

Even as the world moves past hardcopies, almost every business has printers to maintain. You need printers for receipts. Some people prefer to print out email and other documents. Offices need to send snail mail. Flyers need to be made. Brochures.

If you haven't wrestled with a printer, you haven't been initiated into the office world yet!
