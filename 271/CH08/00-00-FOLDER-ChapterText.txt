This is part two of System Management (aka SysAdmin cool stuff). Plan on another 10ish hours to work through the content here. We'll be looking at Active Directory (which is a *huge* part of being a SysAdmin) as well as preventative maintenance and some common problems.

* 8.01: Active Directory
* 8.02: Users and Groups
* 8.03: Remote Services
* 8.04: VPN
* 8.05: Updates
* 8.06: System Backup
* 8.07: System Recovery
* 8.08: Windows Boot Errors
