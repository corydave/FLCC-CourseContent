The final exam in this class is through TestOut. If you do well enough, you'll get a certification. It's not a CompTIA certification, but it's still cool!

I don't have any control over the final (in fact, I can't even see the questions!). But I know that it's just like the labs and quizzes. 

The final closes at noon (12:00 pm) on May 17. Please have *all your work done* by then; no work for this class will be accepted past that date and time.

Unrelated to this course, you might want to think about the CompTIA A+ exams (there are two - one for hardware and one for operating systems). TestOut was *just* purchased by CompTIA because TestOut has curriculum that is 100% aligned with CompTIA exams. That means that if you enjoyed this class and are interested in taking the CompTIA certification exam(s), you have learned everything you need! And as a student at FLCC, you get special pricing (like, 50% off!). [Here is a link to the CompTIA discount exam voucher website](https://academic-store.comptia.org/certification-vouchers/c/11332?facetValueFilter=tenant~user-type%3aindividual%2ctenant~certification%3acomptia-a-core-1-and-2&). Note that this exam is not required for this course. I recommend buying an exam voucher and taking the test(s) over the summer!
