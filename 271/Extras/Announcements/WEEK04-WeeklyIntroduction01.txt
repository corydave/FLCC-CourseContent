^^ WEEK 04 - Weekly Introduction [Part I]

# Important
Hey folks! I've been at a conference the past few days, and I'll be coming back to New York this week. In the meantime, I wanted to let you know that I am feverishly trying to answer emails in between the sessions here, so if it takes a little longer to hear back from me, don't worry! I haven't forgotten about you!

I believe I am caught up on grading (except for work that was due Monday - that's still waiting for me! - and some late assignments that trickled in over the past week). Don't worry! I'll catch up on that, too!

Thanks for your patience!

**NOTE:** I have not yet transferred the grades from TestOut to Blackboard, so don't worry.
