^^ WEEK 10 - Weekly Introduction

^= =

# System Implementation
Not gonna lie - this is not one of my favorite chapters (but it *does* talk about virtualization, which is cool!).

You might want to look at chapters 12 and 13 if you have extra time - they are the last two chapters and are a bit beefy!

Keep up the great work, and if you need anything, let me know! Don't forget that there is a 2 week grace period (up until the last day of classes), but it's not good to rely on it. Since the last two chapters are HUGE, if you have previous work to do during that time *you will be scrambling!*.

Be well!
