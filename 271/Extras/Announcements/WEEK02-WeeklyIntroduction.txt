^^ WEEK 02 - Weekly Introduction

^= = 

# Thanks
Thank you to everyone so far who has helped build the class community by participating in the FlipGrid. 

And thanks for an awesome experience so far!

# What to expect
This week we will be looking at PC Technician responsibilities. The biggest takeaway (from my perspective) is to try. Find an old computer and take it apart. Get your hands dirty.

* One thing I recommend is a PC toolkit (you'll see that in 2.4.1). You can buy good ones for under $20
on Amazon, but the best in the biz is the [iFixit toolkit for $70](https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Pro-Tech-Toolkit/IF145-307) - it's really high quality

* I'll be adding another place for you to add articles (if you want to) in Blackboard as they relate to the current chapter :)

# Grading
The way grades work in this class (for the most part) is that I'll transfer them manually from TestOut to Blackboard. If you did not finish the TestOut assignments before I transfer, you'll have to wait until the following Monday for me to transfer them (and remember, you only have a 2 week grace period).

# Meetings
Thank you to all that I've met with already, and I'm looking forward to meeting with the rest of you in the coming weeks! One thing to keep in mind - Starfish has double booked me for most of the meetings! So if you try to log on to the Google Meet and I don't let you in immediately, just come back in 4 or 5 minutes please. The meetings don't last super long.
