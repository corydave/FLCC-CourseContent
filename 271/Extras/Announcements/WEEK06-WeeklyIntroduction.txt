^^ WEEK 06 - Weekly Introduction

# Did somebody say... Networking???
It's time to 
I actually find them pretty fun. And knowing about RAIDs will be a big asset for you.

# What to watch out for
Do you know the difference between CAT6 and CAT5E? Do you know what POE means (for Ethernet)? Do you wanna do a deep dive into packets, TCP, and other nerdy things (if the answer is "no", *too bad!*)?

This chapter will probably take around 9 or 10 hours. And I'm not gonna lie, it gets nerdy. Like, real nerdy. There are a LOT of things to know. If you are in CSC-260 - Networking Technologies, you get it ðŸ˜†.

# Transferring grades
All grades from TestOut have been transferred. As of noon, 2/28, the grades are accurate. Just a reminder, grades from chapters 4, 5, and 6 are the only ones that can be adjusted now. There's still time!

# Need anything?
If you need *anything*, let me know. I'm here for you!
