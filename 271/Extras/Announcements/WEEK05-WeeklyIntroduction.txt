^^ WEEK 05 - Weekly Introduction

# Time to nerd out (again)
...although you might find this type of nerding out less fun than the previous time (Chapter 3). This time we'll be looking at storage devices. 

I actually find them pretty fun. And knowing about RAIDs will be a big asset for you.

# What to watch out for
This chapter is around 8 or 9 hours of work. Plan accordingly.

# Transferring grades
All grades from TestOut have been transferred. As of noon, 2/21, the grades are accurate. Just a reminder, grades from chapters 3, 4, and 5 are the only ones that can be adjusted now. I know chapter 3 was quite long, and there are still a number of you who haven't finished it. There's still time!

# Need anything?
If you need *anything*, let me know. I'm here for you!
