^^ END OF SEMESTER NOTES

# Congratulations
Ya did it! You made it to the end! The semester officially ended today!!! I'm so happy for you - now you get to (hopefully) slow down a little bit.

Please don't stop tuning in to Blackboard or your email for the next week or so, though as I'll be sending a few more updates.

# Grading
The grades in this class are *mostly* done. There are a few assignments that haven't been graded yet. For instance, the final exam was due today and I haven't graded it. Don't panic - I'm devoting the next few days to that. 

# The next few days
In the next few days, look for an announcement in Blackboard (and your email!) that talks about the final grades. I'll let you know when they are posted. I like to give you a few days to verify they look right and there are no issues with the grades before I officially submit them. They need to be submitted on 5/24, and today is 5/17. I hope to have the final grades in your class posted by 5/20 (or before). That will give you a few days to review my work. Remember, a few things can happen:

* The grades were recorded wrong if I had to do it manually (I think in the 19 years I've been teaching, this has happened twice - but I'm getting older and it's tougher to see! So keep me on my toes!).

* You received a zero on an assignment that you didn't hand in, and then when I graded it the zero was not overwritten. This happens a lot because of the way Blackboard works. It's on you to check your grades.

* Other.

Once grades are submitted, they are in; I will not change them. So please make sure you do review your grades once they are posted.

# Stay tuned
This is not the last message for this course!
