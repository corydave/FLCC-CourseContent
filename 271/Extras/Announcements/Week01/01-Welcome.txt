^^ WEEK 1 - Welcome!

^= =

# Hiya folks!

Welcome to the first week of the semester!

This is the only week where there will be two different chapters (every other week only has one chapter). There are two different threads to pull this week - Chapter 0, which deals with getting-to-know-you activities and orientation and Chapter 1, which is the first chapter in TestOut (it's an overview of computers).

I'd recommend starting with Chapter 0 first. Naturally, if you have any questions, email me at dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu.
