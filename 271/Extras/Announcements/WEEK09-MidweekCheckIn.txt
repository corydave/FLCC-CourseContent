^^ WEEK 09 - Midweek Check In

Hey folks - just dropping in to say that you should be looking at the grade book in Blackboard since it's the official grade book. 

Other than that, I hope you're enjoying Mobile Systems (there's some prescient stuff in there considering the pandemic).

Enjoy your weekend!!!!
