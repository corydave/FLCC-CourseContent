^^ WEEK 02 - Midweek Check In

Just a quick note to say HI and I hope you're doing well! I've met with a number of you so far (thanks for scheduling meetings in Starfish!). Just a few reminders:

1. Chapter 2 in TestOut is due Monday.

2. All work from here on out is *exclusively* done in TestOut; no need to submit anything in Blackboard.

3. Every Monday I transfer grades from the current chapter from TestOut into Blackboard. I also update any grades in the two week grace period. So if you didn't finish Chapter 1 in TestOut by this past Monday but it's done now, don't worry! Your grade will be updated on this coming Monday!

Just a little **xkcd** humor for you:
