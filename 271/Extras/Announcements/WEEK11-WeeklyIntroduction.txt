^^ WEEK 11 - Weekly Introduction
 
# Laker Day
I hope you had a good Laker Day and took advantage of some of the offerings at the college (including TACOS!). Laker Day is always a good opportunity to recharge - please make sure that if you missed it this week you plan to attend next week).

# File Management
Not a favorite chapter of mine, but there's some cool stuff in here. File permissions are cool (especially in Linux!).

# Time Management
Just a reminder that chapters 12 and 13 are *extremely time intensive*. Please consider that! After this current chapter, those are the last two chapters. THEY TAKE A LOT OF TIME. If you have the ability, set aside some time and work on them *now*.
