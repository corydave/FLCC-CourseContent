# Welcome

Hiya! Welcome to CSC-721: Hardware and Operating Systems! This class has two main throughlines:

* **Hardware:** We will look at the nitty gritty of hardware. Nuanced, picky stuff. Like, do you know the difference between L1, L2, and L3 cache? Yeah, we'll get that detailed.

* **Operating Systems:** We'll spend a lot of time working with Windows, but we'll also check out Linux and even MacOS a bit.

This class covers the content for not one, *but two* CompTIA A+ exams (220-1001 and 220-1002). There are 9 competencies that the CompTIA A+ certification validates:

^= = = ,,

* Hardware
* Operating Systems
* Software Troubleshooting
 
^=== ,,

* Networking
* Hardware & Network Troubleshooting
* Security

^=== ,,

* Mobile Devices
* Virtualization & Cloud Computing
* Operational Procedures

^=

<br />

This class has a lot of hands-on experiences and is constantly shifting gears. Every chapter is a different topic!

We'll be using software called TestOut for this class. Every single thing you need to know is in there. The videos are great, the simulations are really freakin' slick, and you'll be able to take away everything covered on both CompTIA A+ exams!

If you have any questions, you can email me at dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu or hit me up on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5MYms7h).
