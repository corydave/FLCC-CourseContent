^^ WEEK 02 - Midweek Check In

Hiya! I hope your week is going well - the weather has been fantastic! Here's what's cooking:

1. Chapter 3 in TestOut is due Monday.

2. If you haven't finished chapter 0 (in Blackboard) or chapter 1 (in TestOut), the absolute final deadline is Monday at noon.

3. There's a rather tricky lab in TestOut this week. Just a tip - if the computer isn't powering up, check to see that the voltage regulator is at 110 instead of 220...

Just a little **xkcd** humor for you:
