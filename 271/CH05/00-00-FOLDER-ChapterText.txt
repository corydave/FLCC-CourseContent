As I was looking over the topics here and digging through TestOut, I was hoping to find the "this is the most important part of this chapter" topic. But I couldn't find one. I think the reason I value all of these is because of the recent and persistent attacks on information (ransomware, for instance). It is *mission critical* to understand management issues, protection issues, and mean-time-to-repair. Backups are table stakes.
