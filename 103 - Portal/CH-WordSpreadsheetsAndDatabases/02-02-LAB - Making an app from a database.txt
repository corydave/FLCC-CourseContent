Databases are handy when you are tracking data that is multidimensional. As an example, an address book typically can be handled in a spreadsheet because the data is relatively flat (that is, there are two dimensions - rows and columns).

But when data gets more sophisticated and becomes dependent on other data, then a database is necessary.

Consider a POS system (Point of Sale) in a restaurant. When a party sits down at a table, a check will be opened in the POS system. Let's say there are five people at the table - the server has to track which of the five people order each item (and how much of each item). Some of the items have multiple options (what are the sides? how is the steak cooked? are there allergies?), and then there are different prices for the items.

Oh yeah - there is also an inventory management system baked into the POS system. Oftentimes daily specials are limited, so some software has to track that inventory.


# Description
In this experience, you will be creating a sweet, sweet POS system for a hardware store! Actually, I guess you can create it for any type of store you want, but the video tutorial is for a hardware store. Feel free to substitute the items with whatever you'd like - you don't need 4x4s and hammers. 

This will be very rudimentary since it's most likely your first dive into databases. We actually won't be automating too many processes or including an inventory. But we *will* include receipts and inventories.

You will be using [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) to create a database. There are four tables you'll need: *Customers*, *Items*, *Receipts*, and *Item Detail* (they are all included in the video). 

Feel free to use the [customer base and item list found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LZgYt3j4v-IyF1tS8PVtFcOMgM_fIPkBs7ZQUw_0Sl8/edit#gid=0) or just make up your own! Note that you should have at least four customers and five items to create a data set that is rich enough to play with.

Note that you should watch the video in it's entirety. Yes, it's a long video (around 24 minutes). This topic might be pretty new to you, but the video walks through every step you need to take to make a POS system.

You do not need to use unique IDs for your primary keys, but if you decide that you'd like to, it's easy! You can [follow this quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZANO7qzSH8) for instructions.

**NOTE**

Though the video shows how to embed the forms and tables into Google Sites, please don't. Instead, just submit a link to the AirTable such that anyone with the link can EDIT.
