Let's look at how Google Docs can really be used as an instrument to rock your research paper skills!

I've made a video that walks through some of the really nifty things you can do with Docs. Your job is to follow along and do all the cool things, too! Make sure you have completed the Spreadsheets [Part II] assignment first - you'll need to pull information from that document.

I've made you a Doc with some sample writing, but the entire document is unformatted. You'll have to follow along and when you're done, your document should look very similar to mine.

To get a copy of the Google Doc, make sure you are logged into your account and [click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KDK3zWYONJ3SdmNiIpk7gONRSKkhxzbftvPTYdt4q1w/copy).

Note that you'll also be exporting your work as a PDF and submitting that. Once you attach the PDF to this submission, you can paste a link to your Google Doc. Verify that the document is shared such that ["Anyone with the link can ***EDIT***"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGXfLDctcI).
