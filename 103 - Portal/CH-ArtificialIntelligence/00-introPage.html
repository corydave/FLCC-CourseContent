<p>Welcome to our <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> module! It's a hot topic right now so I hope you find this interesting and learn something new. We'll mostly be working with Generative AI - and here's an overview so you know where that falls...</p>
<p><strong>🧠 Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;</strong>- creating machines that can simulate human intelligence</p>
<p><strong>📈 Machine Learning (ML)</strong> - a subset of AI that gives computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed... algorithms can be trained on data to make predictions or choices</p>
<p><strong>🎶 Deep Learning (DL)&nbsp;</strong>- a subset of ML that uses neural networks to analyze high-dimensional data like images, audio, and text</p>
<p><strong>🌑 Generative AI (GenAI)</strong> - a subset of DL that focuses specifically on creating <span style="color: #2f5e00;"><strong>new</strong></span> content (okay, I struggled to pick an emoji, but that's the "<strong>new</strong> moon" emoji!)</p>
<p>In other words, GenAI is a subset of DL which is a subset of ML which is a subset of AI. So we're only checking out one (yet amazing!) aspect of all that can be accomplished with AI.</p>
<p>There is so much to learn here, it could be an entire course on its own. You'll get to see some up-to-date cool stuff, but if you come across any articles, videos, cool resources, or thought-provoking information that you think I should know about, let me know at <a rel="noopener" href="mailto:paige.labarr@flcc.edu">paige.labarr@flcc.edu</a> 😀</p>
<p>A few notes before we get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are TONS of opinions out there on AI right now. Some of you will love this chapter and some of you might not - that's okay!&nbsp;</li>
<li>Some of the sites you encounter in this chapter might be a bit sales-pitchy. You don't need to buy anything. You shouldn't need to buy anything. Many sites have a free trial (sometimes 1 week, sometimes 1 month) if you want to try out "pro" features. Anything that's required will involve no account or a free account.</li>
<li>There is some AI-generated content in this chapter, like a podcast and an infographic. That will be declared when you encounter those documents.</li>
<li>You can use AI all you want in this chapter! However, do not assume that is the case for any college assignment. Reach out to the course instructor with any questions regarding if/how AI use is permitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
