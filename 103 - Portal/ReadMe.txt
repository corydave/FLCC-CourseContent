The Blackboard Shell is located in this folder - you can import it if you'd like.

All of the content in this folder is for CSC-103. For the most part, it is complete. There are some things (like videos and assignments) in later chapters that are not quite done. For instance, the Databases assignment is not yet done in Chapter 9. Nor is the Resume Judging assignment in Chapter 5. But they'll be added (and this message amended) when they are added.

A special thanks to Aaron Sullivan for making the md2Bb software!
