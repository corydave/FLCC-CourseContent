^tab

* To create a variable, use the "set" command to give the variable a value, and prepend the name of the variable with a "$":
    * `(set: $pancakes to 0)`
*To display a variable, use the “print” command
    * `(print: $pancakes)`
* You can update a variable based on its current value:
    * `(set: $pancakes to $pancakes + 1)`

^tab

* If you want to ask the user for a piece of information (and then use it later on), the easiest way to do that is using the “prompt” command.
* In the following example, this line of code will both prompt a user for their name and then also set the value to `$name`:
    * `(set: $name to (prompt: "Your name, please:", ""))`
