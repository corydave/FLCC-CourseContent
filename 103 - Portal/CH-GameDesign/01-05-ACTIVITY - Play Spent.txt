^^ ACTIVITY - Play Spent

Spent is a simulation (which is a genre in gaming). Here is a description from their website:

Launched by McKinney in 2011, SPENT has been played more than 10 million times across the globe. The goal of the game: Start with $1,000 and make the decisions necessary to reach the end of the month with something still left in your pocket. We wish you luck.Â </center>

As you are playing, make sure you pay attention to your reactions. The simulation is meant to be realistic. Maybe a bit provocative. How does it make you feel? What happens at the end of the simulation? Did you make it through?

I'm going to ask you to write a reflection after going through the simulation. Remember that this is categorized as a *simulation*. Spent is meant to help the player understand the challenges of poverty.
