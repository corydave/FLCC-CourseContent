^^ WEEK 05 - Midweek Check In

^= =

# How ya doin?

Only a few things to mention folks:

* The Messy Problem is involved. Please make sure you appropriately dedicate the resources you need for it.

* Some of you stumbled across an assignment I thought I had hidden - the Old School Graphics assignment. If you did it, that's extra credit! If you didn't see it or do it, don't worry about it; it will not affect your grade.

* All assignments that have been submitted are almost all graded - I should be done by Monday at the latest.
