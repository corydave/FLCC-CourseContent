^^ FINAL GRADES ARE POSTED!

# Thank you
Thank you for a wonderful semester. I was so so soooooo appreciative of the final reflections. I was reminded of all the cool, innovative work you've done this semester!

# Final grades
Final grades are posted in Blackboard. If you observe any issues with your grades, you need to let me know as soon as possible. I will be submitting the grades Tuesday night at 5:00 PM.

Remember, if you were given a zero on an assignment and then submitted it late, Blackboard might not overwrite the grade. It is on you to tell me if there are any issues with your grades! Please make sure you email me by 5:00 PM on Tuesday if you see *any issues* with your grades!

# Thank you again
Again, thank you for being awesome!
