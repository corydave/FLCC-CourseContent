^^ WEEK 12 - Weekly Introduction

# What's going on this week
ETHICS! I always go into this chapter thinking no one is going to like it, but I typically find that in general people *love* it. You really get to step back from the technical creation process and interrogate the human side of technology.

Unmanned drones. Always-on home technology. Biased algorithms. Even the way society changes and adapts to the technology (for instance the recent news about [girls contracting tics from TikTok](https://fortune.com/2022/03/31/teen-girls-tourette-tics-tiktok/#:~:text=most%20to%20you.-,Teen%20girls%20are%20developing%20neurological%20tics%20and%20disorders%2C%20potentially%20from,videos%20catered%20to%20their%20interests.).

This chapter gives you an opportunity to find something that you find ethically troubling with technology and dive deeper.

# Grades
I know there is still some work to grade, but I'm working through it. Thank you for your patience!
