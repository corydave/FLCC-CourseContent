^^ WEEK 09 - Midweek Check In

Hey folks! I hope web design is going well for you! If any of you are in CSC-270, stay tuned for chapter 10 in a few weeks because we'll be looking at the hacker side of web design (and if you aren't in that class, I hope to see you there in a future semester!).

If you have any questions about the current chapter, lemme know!

Enjoy the weekend!
