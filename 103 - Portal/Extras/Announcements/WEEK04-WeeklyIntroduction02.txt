# Welcome

Welcome to Chapter 3 - Computational Thinking! This is a fun introduction into the domain of "how computer professionals think". It's not everything you need to know, but hopefully you walk away with some very positive experiences and a fresh perspective of how you attack problems.

# Please note

This chapter spans two weeks. The first week has a few things that are noteworthy:

* The discussion about shopping carts is due 2/18; there is no grace period for this assignment. That is because the conversation in the Discussion will inform the work that is due 2/21.

* There is no video for making a flowchart... yet. Don't worry! It will be posted soon! But you can get started without it; you don't need it to do the assignment.

* In both the FLOWCHARTS and PSEUDOCODE assignments, there are quizzes that you must take (and pass!) before you can see the actual assignment.

* The MESSY PROBLEM is one of the most critical assignments of the semester; please make sure you spend a lot of time on the assignment (and read the instructions). If you have questions on it (especially if you live far away from campus), contact me!
