^^ WEEK 13 - Weekly Introduction

# Word Processing && Spreadsheets && Databases
This chapter ***is two weeks long!!!*** The first week has three experiences; please make sure you do them in order. 

I know it sounds boring (ugh - word processing *and* spreadsheets!!!), but I tried to show you some of the really cool things you can do with Google Docs and Google Sheets.

The next week, Databases, is new this year. I'm curious what you think of it. The video isn't posted yet (but it will be!) but you can watch the slide show if you want. Don't worry - I'll have the video posted by next week. 

This chapter *is the last chapter!* After this, it's just the portfolio!!!

# Portfolio
The portfolio will take what you've done with Google Sites and ask you to fill in different artifacts. You'll also be providing a summary. Don't worry - it won't be assigned until May 9 (but you can look at it in **Upcoming Experiences** if you'd like!
