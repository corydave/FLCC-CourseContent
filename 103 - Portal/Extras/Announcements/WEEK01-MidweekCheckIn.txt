^^ WEEK 01 - Midweek Check In

# Getting to know you

I'm enjoying the opportunity to get to know you. Thanks for posting in the Discussion and FlipGrid.

I've already met some of you one-on-one; thanks for setting up appointments! If we haven't met yet, I'm stoked to see you!

# Library assignment
There is an assignment where you will need to go through the Library tutorial, take a quiz, and then send me the results. Note that there are three phases:

1. You submit it once.

2. I give you a zero on it (no matter what your results are).

3. Then you resubmit it. 

This is just so you get practice resubmitting in Blackboard. It's weird. I know. 

Thanks for indulging me.

# Work ahead

Don't forget you can work ahead in this class! Look at the workload for the upcoming weeks in this class and other classes to see if you need to balance your time.
