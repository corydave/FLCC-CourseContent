^^ WEEK 12 - Midweek Check In

# Check In
I haven't heard too much about this current unit. The next unit sounds boring, but a lot of students (like, more than normal) always tell me they enjoy it. I dunno. Spreadsheets and databases sound boring to me (actually, that's a lie. I love them).

# Grades
Thanks for your patience as I finish up grading!
