^^ WEEK 02 - Midweek Check In

^= =

Hey folks! We're about halfway through the week, and here's some things that you might want to chew on.

1. The INFOGRAPHIC assignment has a *rubric* attached. You should watch the video in this announcement so you can understand *why having access to a rubric will help you a ton*.

2. I've graded *almost* everything that has been submitted so far. Keep up the awesome work! Remember that there is a two week grace period built in, so if you are behind and haven't handed work in yet, you have another week (and change) to hand some in. I usually put zeros in for work that was due but not submitted. Don't worry - those zeros can be overwritten if you get your work in during the 2 week grace period!
