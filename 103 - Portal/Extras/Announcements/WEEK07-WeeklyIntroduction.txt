^^ WEEK 07 - Weekly Introduction

# Chapter 5 - Careers && Planning
This week we'll be looking at career possibilities. We'll also begin to codify our plans for the future semesters. Note that in the experience where you are charting out future semesters keep in mind the following:
* This is not set in stone and you can always change it - the intent here is to show *what to expect* for the rest of your time at FLCC.

* There are four hidden semesters under the visible ones in the Google Sheet. You can reveal them by hitting the PLUS sign in the left margin.

# Things to look out for
You'll be taking a personality test - this one is kinda-sorta-maybe accurate (as are many personality tests). Specifically, this one has come under fire for not being super accurate (you may take it twice in two weeks and get different results).

Note that this is a two week chapter - the second week is allocated towards getting your registration ready (you won't be able to register yet) and ***reflecting on the process***. This is the second assignment that will be part of the assessment process. So please take care to devote a lot of attention to it.
