^^ The Turing Test

# Description

In this activity, we will explore human-generated and AI-generated content. Then we will consider and discuss how we feel about AI-generated work and the potential impacts of AI on our society.

In 1950, Alan Turing proposed a test:

*The Turing test... is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation was a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel, such as a computer keyboard and screen, so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator could not reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine would be said to have passed the test. The test results would not depend on the machine's ability to give correct answers to questions, only on how closely its answers resembled those a human would give.*

1. [Take this version of Turing Test](https://daveghidiu.com/103/turingTest.html)  that the FLCC Computing Sciences department created with a tool called [Twine](https://twinery.org/) - it is also embedded below.

2. When you finish, you will be presented with a final result. Please take a screenshot that shows your name and how you did.

3. In a cloud-based document (such as Google Docs), paste your result.

4. Answer the following questions in your document as well:

    1. Do you think AI-generated work is original? Why or why not?<br /><br />

    2. Is it important for the evolution of a society to have members that continue to produce original work? Why or why not?<br /><br />

    3. When looking at a piece of work to evaluate its quality, merit, and/or value, is it important that we know if that piece of work is generated by a human or by AI? Why or why not?
