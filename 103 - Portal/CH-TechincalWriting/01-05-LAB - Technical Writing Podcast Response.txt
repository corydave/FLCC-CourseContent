^^ LAB - Technical Writing Podcast Response

# Description

The CodeNewbie Podcast is a great podcast to subscribe to. It contains stories from people on their coding journey. [Check out their website](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast) and be sure to subscribe; the episodes are really insightful for aspiring software engineers.

In December 2022, Philip Kiely sat down for an interview on the podcast and talked about *technical writing*. Much of the conversation centers around his perspective about how technical writing is vital to software development.

Listen to the podcast and write a response.

* The podcast is embedded below or [you can listen here](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/technical-writing-e3787c31-47c8-4bbe-83b4-ca58ff809e06). The entire episode is around 35 minutes, but Philip starts talking about technical writing at the 9:33 mark. I'd recommend listening to the whole episode, but if you just want to listen to him talk about technical writing, skip ahead to 9:33.
