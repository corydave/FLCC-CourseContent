This experience will guide you through some basics of using Windows (you can use Windows 7, 8, 10, and 11 for this). You'll need to [click here to get a copy of the Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lX28m3nYPF81xGuQMuG9_wnKGbk4KX09UBsTD6ESVcY/copy). 

As you read through the document, you will be prompted to take screenshots and paste them into boxes - the boxes will resize automatically.

When you are done, you should submit a link to a cloud-based document (such as Google Docs) such that ["Anyone with the link can COMMENT"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGXfLDctcI).
