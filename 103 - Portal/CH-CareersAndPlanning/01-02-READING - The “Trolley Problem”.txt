^^ READING - The “Trolley Problem”

You will be considering different self-driving scenarios in the Moral Machine by MIT in the next lab. It is based on a thought experiment you might be familiar with known as [*The Trolley Problem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem). However, some philosophers think that our current advancements in self-driving cars require a rethink of the traditional Trolley Problem. 

If you are interested, you can read [The “Trolley Problem” Doesn’t Work for Self-Driving Cars ](https://spectrum.ieee.org/av-trolley-problem) in Spectrum, the trade magazine from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 

If you *really want a wild ride*, give the podcast episode of RadioLab ([Driverless Dilemma](https://radiolab.org/podcast/driverless-dilemma-0923)) a listen.
