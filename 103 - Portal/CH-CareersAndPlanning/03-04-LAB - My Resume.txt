^^ LAB - My Resume

# Description

Submit a *high quality* resume that demonstrates your skills and work experience (if possible). You can use any software you'd like, but don't forget the [resources we went over in class](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17oPce0Iq69kuFhr2fHZu-qYetVpQL91XjazVvYd-37I/preview) (specifically [Canva.com](https://www.canva.com/)).

Your resume should be stylistic and accurate. If you don't have a lot of experience, you can instead design a resume that would accurately reflect yourself in the future (you should have a pretty good idea of degrees/internships/certifications you might need, so put them on your future-resume! Don't go wild--keep your fake experience tempered so that it seems real (and is actually a career goal).

For instance, perhaps you don't have any experience as a network technician. You can make up a job at a company that you probably would be able to do when you graduate, and one day a real job would take the place on your resume in lieu of this fictional job.

The intent of this exercise is to:

1. Gain an appreciation of the job market and expectations of employers

2. Leverage tools to create a rockin' resume

# Specifications

* Submit a link to a cloud-based document such as Google Docs or Canva.

* If you have an existing resume, you may use that. But make sure that it is updated to be accurate *and* to leverage a cool, modern layout

* Verify that the document is shared such that ["Anyone with the link can COMMENT"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGXfLDctcI).
