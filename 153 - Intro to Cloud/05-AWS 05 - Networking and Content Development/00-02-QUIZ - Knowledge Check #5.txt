After watching the videos and reading the content, please take the Knowledge Check (Quiz) in the AWS platform. You may take this quiz as many times as you'd like.

The grades are not transferred from the AWS platform to Brightspace immediately, but they will ultimately wind up in the Brightspace Grade Book.
