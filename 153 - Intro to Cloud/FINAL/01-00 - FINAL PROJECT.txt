^^ FINAL PROJECT

This class has a final project with the following intent:

^=^ ,,,,

<br />

Learners will produce a document that explains how AWS cloud architectural principles and web content and delivery technologies can be used/applied to managing operations at an organization.				

^=

I'm interested in what *you* think this should look like. We will discuss the specifications in class and formalize the content and format. Things to consider:

## CONTENT COVERED
* This project needs to demonstrate understanding of the AWS content:
    * Describing Cloud Concepts
    * Cloud Economics & Billing
    * AWS Global Infrastructure
    * AWS Cloud Security
    * Networking & Content Delivery
    * Compute
    * Storage
    * Databases
    * Cloud Architecture
    * Auto Scaling & Monitoring

## EXPLORING OTHER CLOUD SERVICES
* This project should involve comparing and contrasting services and prices from other competitors (Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud).

## SCENARIO-BASED
* There will most likely be a scenario where you will be working at a fictitious company.
    * A scenario where you work at a company and are tasked with determining if cloud computing is appropriate for your company and, if so, providing a rational argument (using the knowledge accrued through the AWS modules).

## FORMAT
* Formats might include:
    * A recorded presentation
    * A written report
    * Other formats - open to suggestions

## SPECIFICATIONS
* The final submission will be a link to your GitHub repository that houses all the materials for your project
* There must be a `README.md` file that describes the project and links to individual assets.
* Assets such as documents, spreadsheets, or slide shows should be stored in the cloud and referenced via hyperlinks/embeds when possible.
