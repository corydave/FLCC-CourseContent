^^ LAB - `markdown` Tutorial

Markdown is a plaintext language that focuses on content, not design. There are certain symbols used (for instance, `#` means "heading one" and `##` means "heading two" and bookending text with one `*` will make the text italic).

In this tutorial, you will explore some of the more popular "commands" in markdown. Some platforms (like GitHub) have special markdown that they have added to the main set of commands; we'll look at a few of those as well.

Your job is to [opy this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pvonN723EddQgu8sa1W35mrdh7V4syipLY7zjiQaLsk/copy) and put your own markdown in the boxes that say "EVIDENCE". You can use any markdown converter that you want (GitHub has one built in! Just create a document with a file extension of `.md`! Or you can [use this one that works in a pinch](https://corydave.github.io/websitetest/tools/md-tester/).
