^^ LAB - `weather.py`

Create a Python file named `weather.py` that will write a simple weather recommendation program. The program should ask the user for the current temperature (as a float) and then print a recommendation.

Use the following criteria:

* **Above 85°F:** "Wow, it's hot! Drink plenty of water."
* **85°F and below:** "It's a nice day, enjoy the outdoors!"

## Specifications

* File name: `weather.py`
* Prompt the user clearly for the temperature in Fahrenheit.
* Convert the input to a float.
* Use `if` and `else` statements to print recommendations exactly.
* Your output must match the Sample Output *exactly*



## Sample Output

```
What's the temperature today? 
75
It's a nice day, enjoy the outdoors!
```

```
What's the temperature today? 
92
Wow, it's hot! Drink plenty of water.
```
