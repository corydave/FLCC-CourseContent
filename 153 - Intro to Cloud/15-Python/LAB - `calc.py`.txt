^^ LAB - `calc.py`

## DESCRIPTION

This lab explores how multiple modules (files, scripts) can work together. 

In this exercise, you will be responsible for both `calc.py` and `calc_util.py`.

This is a very simply four function calculator. There is nothing tricky here - just addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Since we have explored `if` statements we can have some decision making and logic flow that kinda-sorta mimics a traditional calculator. 

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Starter code has been provided for this lab - there are two files:
    * `calc.py` is what will be run when you submit. You have an empty canvas with this file.

    * `calc_util.py` is the companion code you will also be submitting. There is some structure to the starter code.

* Modify both files to mirror the sample output. Note that the following methods *must be present* in the utility module:
    * `add(num1, num2)`
    * `subtract(num1, num2)`
    * `divide(num1, num2)`
    * `multiply(num1, num2)`

* You should cast the input as `float` when you capture the numbers from the users.

* Be sure to fill out the comments at the top of the files as well as the bottom of the files. This includes your name, date, a brief description of the program, and some reflection pieces.
