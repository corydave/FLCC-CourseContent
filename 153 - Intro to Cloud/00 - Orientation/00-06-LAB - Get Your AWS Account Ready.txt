Much of the content in this course has been provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). There are a number of careers targeted by AWS certifications. Some of them include:
1. Solutions architect
2. Application architect
3. Cloud data engineer
4. Software development engineer
5. Systems administrator
6. DevSecOps Engineer

If you'd like to see a complete list (along with the certifications needed for each), [click here](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs/AWS_certification_paths.pdf). 

But one thing is certain - almost every pathway starts at the Cloud Foundations certification. And that's what this class prepares you for!

For this lab, you will be getting situated in the AWS platform. We won't use Brightspace for the AWS content - they have their own learning management software. But don't worry! Their system is easy to follow.

You should have an invite in your FLCC email. Please follow the instructions and log into the AWS course. When you are done, take a screenshot and submit it ðŸ˜ƒ
