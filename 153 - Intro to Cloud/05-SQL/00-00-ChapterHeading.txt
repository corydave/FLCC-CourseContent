**SQL**, or *structured query language*, is a computer language that let's you interface with a database. SQL is quite extensive - if you master the craft you will  probably never have trouble finding a job.

In this course, we will do a brief intro into SQL. Happily, `codeCademy` has a brilliant course that covers some of the basics. 

One of the things I like about SQL is that it is a language that is pretty easy to understand. 

* `CREATE TABLE`, for instance, will create a table.
* `INSERT INTO` will add a new row to the table.
* `SELECT` is how you get information from the table - you'll be using this pretty much all the time.
* `DELETE FROM` will, you guessed it, delete data from a table.

In this chapter, you will create a free `codeCademy` account (you can login with your GitHub account if you'd like!) and go through the SQL course. There is no need to pay for the full course; you'll be fine with the free version. You won't be able to do some of the labs, but you'll get a basic understanding of SQL.
