Please complete the lab in the AWS platform. Some of the labs take a lot of time - please be sure you have enough time carved out to dedicate to your lab.

The grades are not transferred from the AWS platform to Brightspace immediately, but they will ultimately wind up in the Brightspace Grade Book.
