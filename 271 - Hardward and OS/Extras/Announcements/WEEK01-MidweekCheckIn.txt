# Getting to know you

I'm enjoying the opportunity to get to know you. Thanks for posting in the FlipGrid.

I've already met some of you one-on-one; thanks for setting up appointments! If we haven't met yet, I'm stoked to see you!

# TestOut

So far, the feedback on TestOut LabSim has been great! I was able to extend the join code, so you can [join here if you haven't yet](https://labsimapp.testout.com/v6_0_480/index.html/createaccount?inviteid=1636d43c-4fb4-40b0-96fa-a82ba1000ee9).

# Work ahead

Don't forget that Chapter 0 and Chapter 1 are both due Monday! Just a reminder, you can always work ahead! One student in this class is already on Chapter 10!!!

# HumbleBundle

Hot off the press! There's a sweet new HumbleBundle out now. For $15, [you can get PC Building Simulator and DLC](https://www.humblebundle.com/games/pc-building-simulator-bundle?hmb_source=&hmb_medium=product_tile&hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_1_c_pcbuildingsimulatorbundle_bundle). You don't need to buy it for this class, but it's a great price!
