^^ WEEK 09 - Weekly Introduction

# Mobile Systems

Hey folks! I hope you had a good break and were able to catch up on work, enjoy some time, sleep in one day, and get outside.

This week we are looking at Mobile Systems. Plan on roughly 5 or 6 hours.

I haven't updated the grades yet, but I will post all current grades as of Monday at noon tonight or tomorrow. 

As always, if you have any questions for me, let me know!
