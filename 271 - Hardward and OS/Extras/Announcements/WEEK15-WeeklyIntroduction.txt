^^ WEEK 15 - Weekly Introduction

# THIS IS IT! THE LAST WEEK! YOU DID IT!!!!

This is the last week of the semester - it officially ends May 17! Just a reminder that no work will be accepted after May 17 (the 2-week grace period has limits, and one of those limits is the semester ending!).

I updated grades again yesterday (Monday). Please make sure ***all work is done by May 17***.

# No Student Hours today

Today, Tuesday May 10, I will not be available for Student Hours. If you need something, please email me!

# Final Exam

No one has taken the Final Exam yet (it's been open for a week!). Please make sure you take it (it's in a different spot than the rest of the content in TestOut - it's a "Certification Exam". If you have questions, let me know!

# It's been fun
...but this isn't the end! I'll drop in one last video when the semester ends, and I'm hopeful that our paths will cross again!
