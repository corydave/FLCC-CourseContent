^^ WEEK 06 - Midweek Check In

# Here's what is happening

Hey folks! It's windy out there (if you are in the western New York region). Stay safe! And plan accordingly (I'll probably lose internet ☹️).

Just a reminder, Chapter 6 is due Monday. I'll also be transferring grades from TestOut from chapters 5 and 4 as well.

If you need anything, lemme know!!!!
