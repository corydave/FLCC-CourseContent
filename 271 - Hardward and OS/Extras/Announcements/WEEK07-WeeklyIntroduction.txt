^^ WEEK 07 - Weekly Introduction

# Wireless Networking
Time to look at WiFi and radios!

If you are in CSC-270 right now (Information Security), then you'll get a double-dose of WiFi (much of the current unit in that class talks about home networks).

If you aren't in the class, you're missing out!

This chapter is a bit shorter than the last one but I think it's one of the most enjoyable.
