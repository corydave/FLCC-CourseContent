^^ FINAL GRADES ARE POSTED!

# Thank you
Thank you for a wonderful semester!!!! It's over! Most of you have your TestOut certification now, and that's great! Add that to your LinkedIn profile and your resumes!

Good luck in future classes (if this isn't your last semester) and your careers! If you need anything, let me know!

# Final grades
Final grades are posted in Blackboard. If you observe any issues with your grades, you need to let me know as soon as possible. I will be submitting the grades Monday night at 5:00 PM.

# Thank you again
Again, thank you for being awesome!
