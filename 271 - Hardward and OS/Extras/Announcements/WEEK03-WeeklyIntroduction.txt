^^ WEEK 03 - Weekly Introduction

^= =

# Time to nerd out
Folks, if you like building your own computer, nerding out about PSUs, showing off the LEDs inside your case, *this* is the unit for you! We'll be looking at motherboards, processors, memory, and a bunch of other components.

# What to watch out for
This chapter is one of the longest - probably twice as long as the previous chapters. Make sure you assess the workload early on this week so you can plan accordingly.


# Transferring grades
As a reminder, I manually transfer the grades from TestOut to Blackboard every Monday around noon. If you aren't finished with chapter 1 or chapter 2 yet, don't worry; finish them by next Monday and they'll be transferred. Remember, there is a 2 week grace period built into the work in this class.
