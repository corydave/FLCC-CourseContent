^^ WEEK 14 - Weekly Introduction

# Hi!

Just a quick note to say, "HI!".

I hope you've been able to manage Chapter 12 and Chapter 13 - they're both quite long. Chapter 12 was due Monday (but you have a 2-week grace period) and Chapter 13 is due this coming Monday.

# Final exam

The Final Exam will be open later tonight!

# Late work

Please remember that the semester ends May 17 - that means you *need to have all your work in by noon that day*.

# May the Fourth be With You
