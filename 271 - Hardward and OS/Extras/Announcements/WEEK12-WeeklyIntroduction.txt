^^ WEEK 12 - Weekly Introduction

^= =

# What's going on this week
This. Is. A. BIG. CHAPTER. There is *a lot* to take in. Please, please, *please* do not wait until the last day.

Chapter 13 is also really big. So plan accordingly.

In case you didn't see the calendar, Chapter 12 is not due on 4/25; it's due the following Monday (May 2). That gives you two weeks to work through Chapter 12 and get a head start on Chapter 13.

Don't forget that all work is due the last day of the semester - no exceptions ðŸ˜­.

# Grades
All grades in Blackboard have been updated. Please make sure you review them as they are the official grades. If you have a question regarding your grades, please let me know!
