^^ WEEK 04 - Midweek Check In

^= =

# Welcome to the weekend
Hey folks! Hopefully you've had some time to sit down and work on the latest chapter (if not, don't worry - it's fairly small).

The grades from TestOut have been transferred. Chapter 0 and Chapter 1 cannot be modified, but if you still want to improve your grade on Chapter 2, you have until Monday. You still have another week to improve your progress on Chapter 3 (it was a big chapter!!!).

Make sure you go out and take a walk - even if it's a short, 10 minute walk. It's refreshing. Clears the brain!
