# Welcome

Hey folks! This chapter is a bit smaller (okay, substantially smaller) than previous chapters. Chances are, this will be a cakewalk for some of you. If you've hung around computers a lot, you'll probably know most of the content in this chapter just by virtue of dorking around on a computer!

The grades from TestOut will be transferred today!
