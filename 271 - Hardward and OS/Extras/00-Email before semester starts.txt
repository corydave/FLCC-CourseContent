# Welcome

Hey folks! Welcome to Hardware & Operating Systems!

I know the semester hasn't started, but I wanted to get you a chance to see the content a bit early! As you probably know, we will be using a product called TestOut LabSim™ this semester. TestOut is really neat - it has great videos, amazing simulations, and covers every bit of information you need for both CompTIA A+ certifications!

If you have access to TestOut already, great! If you don't, you may want to get it soon. You can get it in the bookstore. I know it's expensive, and I'm sorry for that (there's nothing I can do about the price - I tried). But the good news is I believe you get access to all the material for a bit after the course ends so you can study for the A+ exams with it if you want.

Here's what you need to know:

You can look at TestOut LabSim™ now, but you'll have to wait until Friday, January 21 to peek into Blackboard. I can't wait to meet you!
