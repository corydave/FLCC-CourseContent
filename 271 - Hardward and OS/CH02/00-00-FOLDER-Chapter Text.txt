Let's take a peek at the different aspects of being a PC Tech. This is a job that many of you will have (I did it for a while - I loved it!). There is always something new - whether it is new technology or new puzzles to solve. 

Last year, even after working with computers for 30 years, I had a friend ask me to help with a problem I had never seen before. She had a tower that had a "corrupt BIOS". It was a neat experience (and fun journey!) to research how to fix it.

Always something new!
