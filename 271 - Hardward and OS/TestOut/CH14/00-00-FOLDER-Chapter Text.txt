This is certainly one of my favorite chapters. If you haven't been in CSC-270: Principles of Information Security, then most of this stuff will be new to you (unless you've encountered it in other places in your life). This very well might be your first introduction to cybersecurity. My guess is that you know some of this stuff already. Either way, I hope you like this chapter. My favorite part is the Social Engineering!
