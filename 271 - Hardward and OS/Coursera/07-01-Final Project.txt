You've covered a lot of ground in this course - from hardware fundamentals to operating systems, security, and troubleshooting. For your capstone, you get to choose how you demonstrate what you've learned.

Pick a project that lets you apply A+ concepts in a way that matters to you. You can use AI however it's helpful - to research, explain, troubleshoot, or create. The goal is to show critical thinking, not just copying. The only stipulations are:

1. You *must* declare how you used AI
2. You *must* vet the work that AI does; please do not submit work from AI unless you've reviewed it thoroughly.

Pick one direction. If you want to focus on a specific topic instead of these options, that's fine too - just talk to me first!

## Troubleshooting Documentation

Solve a real problem on a device you have access to (your laptop, a family member's computer, etc.). Document what went wrong, how you diagnosed it, and what the fix was.

## IT Health Audit

Audit a system you can access (your home setup, a small business, a school department). Document the hardware inventory, OS details, security practices, and make recommendations for improvement.

## Teach the Concept

Pick one A+ topic that confused or interested you. Create a teaching artifact—a guide, video script, interactive explanation, or study resource that explains it clearly to someone else.

##  Certification Prep Resource

Create a study guide, practice problem set, or flashcard deck focused on one A+ domain.

## Build an app

Use AI to build an app that showcases some of the learning you've experienced during this course. Or a simulated lab. Whatevs!

## Your Idea

Have something else in mind? Talk to me. If it demonstrates A+ knowledge in a meaningful way, let's do it.

Turn in whatever format makes sense for your project. A document, a GitHub repo, a website, a video, a guide - whatever works.
