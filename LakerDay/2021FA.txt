^^ LAKER DAY!!!

# LAKER DAY!

^= =
Tuesday, 10/19, is Laker Day! This means ***there are no classes***. It *also* means that there are a number of activities you can enjoy throughout the day! You can see them all at [the FLCC Laker Day website](https://flcc.edu/lakerday/).

Many of these activities have *free food* and _all_ of them are awesome.

Note that lunch is served 11-2 but you'll need to [fill out this form first]( https://flcc.formstack.com/forms/laker_day_lunch) so they can get an accurate headcount.

The Computing Sciences department is hosting two sweet, sweet events.

# Movie & WAFFLE BAR!

Join the Computing Sciences department for a movie and A WAFFLE BAR! Yes, you read that right. Bespoke, artisan waffles. YOU get to pick the toppings. YOU get to pick the candy. YOU get to pick the fruit. YOU get to pick the sprinkles. YOU get to pick the whipped cream. WE get to pick the movie.


We'll be watching The Imitation Game with Benedict Cumberbatch and Kiera Knightley. It's a pretty rad movie. Even if you don't want to watch the movie, swing by and enjoy a waffle! Movie starts at 2, but if you can't make it for the whole thing, just come when you can! Waffles will be available 2-4.

* Location: Cafeteria, 2FL Student Center, Canandaigua Campus

* Time: 2:00pm- 4:00pm
