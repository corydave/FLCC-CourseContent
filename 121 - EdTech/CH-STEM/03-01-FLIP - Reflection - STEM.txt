^^ FLIP - Reflection - STEM

Please take this opportunity to reflect on the week. Reflection is a form of *metacognition* (that means thinking bout your thinking). These small exercises have been shown to improve thinking and learning. 

Here is the prompt for this week:

^=^ ,

This week I'd like input on two different things - what was your **favorite** lab this week (and why). And what was your **least favorite** lab this week (and why).

Anything you say will not affect your grade - I use the input from these Flips to strengthen the experience for future students.
