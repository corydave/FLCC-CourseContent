^^ LAB - Create a Class Schedule with Canva

In the spirit of learning-as-you-go, there are no specifications for this lab. You should create a Class Schedule using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). You may use a template or start from scratch. Note that if you use a template you need to change the content to make it something you would use in your own classroom.
