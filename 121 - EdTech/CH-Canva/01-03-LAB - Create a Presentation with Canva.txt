^^ LAB - Create a Presentation with Canva

In the spirit of learning-as-you-go, there are no specifications for this lab. You should create a presentation using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). You may use a template or start from scratch. Note that if you use a template you need to change the content to make it something you would use in your own classroom.

For funsies, see if you can find the "secret keys" to press during a presentation. One of them (my favorite) is "c". See if you can find out what it does - and any other keys, too.
