^^ JOURNAL - Google Slides Reflection

# Description

Google Slides (and Microsoft PowerPoint) are well known for their ability to make slide shows. But did you know you can use them for desktop publishing? Instead of Google Docs or Microsoft Word, you could use a tool that affords you more flexibility.

We will be looking at layers, guidelines, and aligning as tools to help your work look awesome!

## Reflect on your experience

This chapter was designed to delicately introduce you to the cool features of Google Slides. Consider this prompt: 

**Some have Google Slides the "Swiss Army Knife" of Google**<br />

1. Other than slide shows, how might you use it in the classroom?

2. What are some of the tools you learned about in Slides that you did not know beforehand?

Every week, we will be reflecting on the things we learned. Typically this will involve software (and how it fits into the context of teaching), cognitive science (how learning works), or just visceral reactions. The intent of these journaling sessions are to help you recognize where the totality of your educational experiences have led you and how those experiences intersect with what we know about teaching and learning. The journal entries are private (you and I are the only ones reading them; they will not be shared to the class).

It is important to note that these journals are not assessed based on the content; I cannot assign you a grade based on your beliefs or your interpretations of what we learned. Instead, I am interested in the rigor of your curiosity. I want to know how what we talk about has informed your approach to teaching. If we are looking at software, how could you leverage that software in class? If we discuss learning science, how will you take what you know and transform it into killer educational experiences?

Each journal will have a unique prompt to it; your job is to respond with passion. Your job is to respond with questions. Your job is to respond with lofty ideas. FLCC is invested in creating a cadre of multidimensional thinkers that can leverage technology and curate phenomenal experiences for K12 students. Your job is to realize that mission by dedicating time to reflect.

I will read every entry and respond - please make sure you read my comments. These journals are symbiotic - I rely on your responses to gage the efficacy of the course. Your candid conversation may drive the direction of this class and inform future iterations of this course.
