Google Slides is probably the best web-based desktop publishing software out there. Sure, [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) is awesome. [LucidPress](https://www.lucidpress.com/pages/) is great, too (but the freemium tier is very limited). But Slides lives in the Google ecosystem, is super easy to share, and is completely free!

Simply changing the canvas size to 8.5 x 11 inches puts you in GO TIME mode. The toolset is pretty incredible once you get used to it.

There are video walkthroughs for both of these experiences üòÅ. If you have any questions, let me know!!!!

# Notes
Some things to keep in mind:

1. Your school might use Microsoft Office instead of Google. That's OK - Microsoft PowerPoint is similar enough that the skills you acquire here will transfer.

2. There is a third assignment listed below and it is crossed off - we won't be doing that this semester.
