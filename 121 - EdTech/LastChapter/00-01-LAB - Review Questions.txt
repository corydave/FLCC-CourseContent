This is it! The last chapter of the semester!

If you'll recall, early on in the semester we looked at Creative Commons and the philosophy of "open". And you'll also notice that there hasn't been any quizzes (other than the Orientation Quiz at the beginning) in this class.

We're going to merge the two of these observations together. Your task is to create three review questions for every chapter we've studied. I've [created a Google Doc template for you to use](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N8pMFF8rKqTjesCH-oLnPRdK1JCxFm9Hggzxpz_6p6g/copy).

Once you make a copy of the document, you'll see where to craft your questions. The instructions are in the document. You can (and should!) replace the existing text in each white rectangle with your work.
