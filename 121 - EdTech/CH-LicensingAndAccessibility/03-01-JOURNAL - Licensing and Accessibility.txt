^^ JOURNAL - Licensing and Accessibility

# Description

This week we examined licensing and accessibility. In addition to awesome modeling for the kiddos, taking these two issues seriously will help prevent you from violating laws (that are easy to break) and help you create equitable learning for all.

## Have you seen educators break one or both of these laws? What is your biggest takeaway regarding licensing? What is your biggest takeaway regarding accessibility?

<br />

### Here is my response:

I have definitely seen educators in violation of copyright and accessibility laws. Many educators (and this is not limited to the domain - I see people everywhere doing this) are quick to use "fair use" as a shield. But the reality is that fair use is a tenuous equivocation at best. I'll admit that when I was a teacher (especially early on in my career), I didn't really care if I was using copyrighted material in my teachings. I'd use images, copyrighted cartoon characters, music, and videos that did not belong to me. I think that I justified it by saying that it was for the greater good - I was teaching the next generation!

But really what I was doing was breaking the law and modeling poor habits to my students.

Honestly, if [https://unsplash.com/](unsplash) and [https://pixabay.com/](Pixabay) had been around back then, I would have totally used them. The images at unsplash are incredible. Pixabay has amazing illustrations. It's ridiculous that all that stuff is free to use and you can modify it however you want.

As far as accessibility is concerned, I witness a lot of infractions that could get people sued all the time. Tools like Blackboard make it easier to be compliant. For instance, when I post content I'll get a prompt if I include an image and I don't add the ALT tag. Blackboard also has a tool called "A11y" that will check my content to make sure it's accessible.

I know it's a pain, but adding ALT tags is definitely worth it. And using styles in Google Docs (Microsoft Word has them, too) is a game changer. Not only does it make the content more accessible, but it also provides other benefits like document outlines and easy-to-change formatting.

The hardest thing to do with accessibility, in my opinion, is to get other educators on board. I used to get a lot of resistance like, "I don't have time" or "it's too hard" or "but I don't have any students who need it". Unfortunately, it kind of doesn't matter. Some day you will have students who benefit from these things. And compliance with the law is always good! I think showing people how to do ALT tags is easy and quick.

Every week, we will be reflecting on the things we learned. Typically this will involve software (and how it fits into the context of teaching), cognitive science (how learning works), or just visceral reactions. The intent of these journaling sessions are to help you recognize where the totality of your educational experiences have led you and how those experiences intersect with what we know about teaching and learning. The journal entries are private (you and I are the only ones reading them; they will not be shared to the class).

It is important to note that these journals are not assessed based on the content; I cannot assign you a grade based on your beliefs or your interpretations of what we learned. Instead, I am interested in the rigor of your curiosity. I want to know how what we talk about has informed your approach to teaching. If we are looking at software, how could you leverage that software in class? If we discuss learning science, how will you take what you know and transform it into killer educational experiences?

Each journal will have a unique prompt to it; your job is to respond with passion. Your job is to respond with questions. Your job is to respond with lofty ideas. FLCC is invested in creating a cadre of multidimensional thinkers that can leverage technology and curate phenomenal experiences for K12 students. Your job is to realize that mission by dedicating time to reflect.

I will read every entry and respond - please make sure you read my comments. These journals are symbiotic - I rely on your responses to gage the efficacy of the course. Your candid conversation may drive the direction of this class and inform future iterations of this course.
