^^ JOURNAL - Reaction to Heutagogy

# Description
This chapter we explored two different technology tools (Nearpod and Pear Deck). While there are similarities to the two tools, you probably can imagine different scenarios where each would be a better choice than the other.

The other thing we explored this chapter is *heutagogy* and *generative learning*. Although this is an overly broad description, learning on your own and "figure-outedness" are valuable traits. It tends to make people uncomfortable (especially juxtaposed with the step-by-step videos we have been using in this class. But not only is it essential for your career (that you explore paths and pull threads), but your students will most certainly need to be equipped with this skill.

Here is your prompt:

## Write a paragraph or two explaining the differences between Nearpod and Pear Deck. Then reflect on how you liked (or disliked) figuring everything out on your own. Was it uncomfortable? What were strategies that helped?

^=,

Every week, we will be reflecting on the things we learned. Typically this will involve software (and how it fits into the context of teaching), cognitive science (how learning works), or just visceral reactions. The intent of these journaling sessions are to help you recognize where the totality of your educational experiences have led you and how those experiences intersect with what we know about teaching and learning. The journal entries are private (you and I are the only ones reading them; they will not be shared to the class).

It is important to note that these journals are not assessed based on the content; I cannot assign you a grade based on your beliefs or your interpretations of what we learned. Instead, I am interested in the rigor of your curiosity. I want to know how what we talk about has informed your approach to teaching. If we are looking at software, how could you leverage that software in class? If we discuss learning science, how will you take what you know and transform it into killer educational experiences?

Each journal will have a unique prompt to it; your job is to respond with passion. Your job is to respond with questions. Your job is to respond with lofty ideas. FLCC is invested in creating a cadre of multidimensional thinkers that can leverage technology and curate phenomenal experiences for K12 students. Your job is to realize that mission by dedicating time to reflect.

I will read every entry and respond - please make sure you read my comments. These journals are symbiotic - I rely on your responses to gage the efficacy of the course. Your candid conversation may drive the direction of this class and inform future iterations of this course.
