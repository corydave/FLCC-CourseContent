Buckle up! We're trying something new. This is a foray into *generative learning* (among other learning theories). Be sure to really dig into the reading (it's only six pages) as it contextualizes the methodology of learning for this chapter.

* **Pear Deck** - You also have to figure out what Pear Deck is, how to use it, and then create an experience using Pear Deck for me.
