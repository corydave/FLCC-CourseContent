A *screencast* is when the screen of a computer is recorded to demonstrate how to use software. Making screencasts is a good way to show students how to use software. You've probably seen screencasts on YouTube (you've definitely seen them in this class). 

There are a lot of different screencasting options out there. I prefer [Screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com/) (it's a Chrome extension, so you don't need to install any software on your computer and it will work on all your computers - as long as you are using the Chrome browser).

Other options include:

* [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/hub) - Great software for capturing your screen and editing the video - free and paid plans

* [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) - I use this on my PC and Mac - it's worth the price if you screencast often

* [Screencast-O-Matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/) - This is also a Chrome extension, but for a small subscription you can get desktop editing capabilities

* [Adobe Captivate](https://www.adobe.com/products/captivate.html) - High end software, but unless you have a big budget, I would look at other options

* [Techsmith Capture](https://www.techsmith.com/jing-tool.html) - Formerly known as Jing, this is decent software made by the same company that makes Camtasia (and it's free!)

* [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) - One of the easiest ways to capture your screen and your face at the same time. Crops your video as a circle, too!

One of the best sources for screencast tips comes from a recent episode from the Cult of Pedagogy podcast ([#144: Everything You Need to Know About Building a Great Screencast Video](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/screencast-videos/)). The episode is 47 minutes long and is definitely worth your time.
