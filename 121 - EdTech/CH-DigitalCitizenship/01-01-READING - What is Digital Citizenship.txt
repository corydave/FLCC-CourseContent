^^ READING - What is Digital Citizenship

Since digital citizenship is a relatively new concept and contains a number of different dimensions, different organizations have different interpretations of the standards, vocabulary, and meaning.

## CommonSense.org

One really neat resource to help understand digital citizenship is the non-profit "CommonSense.org". They have some pretty wonderful interpretations of digital citizenship as well as interactive activities, broken down by year in school! I definitely recommend poking around here for a little bit to get a sense of what digital citizenship is and also understanding what resources are available for you to use in your classroom.

## New York State Department of Education

Though New York State doesn't explicitly refer to it as *digital citizenship*, they *do* provide **Computer Science and Digital Fluency Learning Standards*. You should also poke around their website and check out the learning standards by grade band.

* [NYSED Digital Fluency Standards](https://www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-and-digital-fluency-learning-standards) - check out the standards for the grade you hope to teach (or are currently teaching!).

## Applied Educational Systems

Another interesting perspective on digital citizenship is written by Applied Educational Systems. Note that this organization isn't part of New York State (AES is a for-profit company) though their thoughts on digital citizenship are interesting.
