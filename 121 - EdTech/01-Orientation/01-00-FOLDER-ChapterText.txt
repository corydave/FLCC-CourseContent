In this chapter we will be acclimating to the class and looking at the cool ways we'll be interacting. There are a bunch of wonky things I do when teaching (like using Google Docs a lot, commenting on work, encouraging resubmitting work) that require a bit of explanation.

In this chapter there are a few experiences where we will get to know each other. Then you'll learn how things operate in this class. Don't panic - it's not painful! Many of you might know each other already as you are probably in some face-to-face classes together. But please indulge me and introduce yourself to everyone else in the course üòÅ!
