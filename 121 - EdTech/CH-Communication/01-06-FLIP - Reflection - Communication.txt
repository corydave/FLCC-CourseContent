^^ FLIP - Reflection - Communication

Please take this opportunity to reflect on the week. Reflection is a form of *metacognition* (that means thinking bout your thinking). These small exercises have been shown to improve thinking and learning. 

Here is the prompt for this week:

^=^ ,

Please share a memory of a communication a teacher you had (K-12) sent home. Maybe it was a news letter, maybe it was a note that needed to get signed. I'd love to know how it made you feel! And what you might do when you have a class.
