<hr />

For this particular exercise, there are two steps.
* You need to do is fill this quiz out and submit it by hitting the purple "Submit" button.

* In Brightspace you will just need to submit some text that says, "I submitted the quiz and the email address I used is `<insert your email address here>`. If you skip this step I might not know if you took the quiz.

You will receive a 100% on this lab even if you answer the questions wrong (in fact, I hope you do miss a question or two so you can see what it looks like from the student perspective).

# SPECIFICATIONS

* Must take the quiz and hit the purple "Submit" button.
* Must leave a note in the Brightspace submission so I know who to give the credit to!
