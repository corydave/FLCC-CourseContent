Google Drawings is a highly underrated tool in the Google Workspace suite. It's a great way to:
* Create original artwork
* House images you'd like to store online (like photographs)
* Create branding for any digital/printed paper you use in your classroom
* Create "hot spot" images.

We will leverage Google Drawings to do three different things:
1. Build a personalized header for documents (digital and printed)
2. Host an image that we want to use later
3. Build an interactive hot spot image

There are video walkthroughs for all of these experiences üòÅ. If you have any questions, let me know!!!!
