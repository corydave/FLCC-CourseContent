This week we designed an avatar, built a favicon, and started work on a Google Site for our portfolio. Craft an introspective response to this prompt:

## How did you express yourself in your avatar and favicon? How do you think your students and their parents will respond to your avatar and favicon? Be sure to include your avatar and favicon in your journal.

<br />

### Here is my response:

I wanted to encapsulate myself as best as I could. My intention is that if you haven't seen me in real life, but you have seen my avatar, I'd like you to maybe recognize me. I chose to use a shirt, tie, and jacket because that's typically how I dress for class. I chose blue eyes (like, really blue) because I think that's one of my prominent features on my face. The hair is a bit off. I've always had short hair (ever since Forrest Gump came out in 1994, I've had a pretty similar haircut. But over the past year, I've started growing it out. I would love hair like what's in my avatar, but I'm not quite there yet. And my eyebrows are actually a bit too heavy in the avatar, but I didn't realize it until just now as I'm reflecting on it. I'll have to go back and change it.

Dave Ghidiu’s favicon. Geometric shapes make up the letters 'D' and 'G'. They are constructed using primary colors (and yellow).
As far as my favicon goes, the one I am using is not the one I made in the video. The one I've included here are my initials, D and G. They are made up of geometric shapes (I was a geometry teacher for eight years!) and they use the primary colors for two reasons - I want to exude a feeling of simplicity (like, a clean, crisp educational experience for my students - something easy, like coloring back in elementary school) and because they are a nod to Google's logo (and I believe a lot of Google's tools are really helpful in education.

Every week, we will be reflecting on the things we learned. Typically this will involve software (and how it fits into the context of teaching), cognitive science (how learning works), or just visceral reactions. The intent of these journaling sessions are to help you recognize where the totality of your educational experiences have led you and how those experiences intersect with what we know about teaching and learning. The journal entries are private (you and I are the only ones reading them; they will not be shared to the class).

It is important to note that these journals are not assessed based on the content; I will not assign you a grade based on your beliefs or your interpretations of what we learned. Instead, I am interested in the rigor of your curiosity. I want to know how what we talk about has informed your approach to teaching. If we are looking at software, how could you leverage that software in class? If we discuss learning science, how will you take what you know and transform it into killer educational experiences?

Each journal will have a unique prompt to it; your job is to respond with passion. Your job is to respond with questions. Your job is to respond with lofty ideas. FLCC is invested in creating a cadre of multidimensional thinkers that can leverage technology and curate phenomenal experiences for K12 students. Your job is to realize that mission by dedicating time to reflect.

I will read every entry and respond - please make sure you read my comments. These journals are symbiotic - I rely on your responses to gage the efficacy of the course. Your candid conversation may drive the direction of this class and inform future iterations of this course.
