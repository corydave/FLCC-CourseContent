^^ Welcome to Technology in Education!

A few things to know before getting started. This Welcome Tour will appear every time you enter this class - until you hit the "Dismiss" button in the bottom. Make sure you check out the video and the Course Outline so you know if this course is right for you.

## The "big things" to know about this course:

* **We're using Brightspace instead of Blackboard** - This is the first semester that we will be using Brightspace (we have been using Blackboard for the past several years). There will be some growing pains. If you find that something doesn't make sense in here or you can't find something, email me! There's a good chance I screwed something up üòÅ! But it is very important that if you have an issue, you reach out to me immediately. If there is anything giving you problems, I want to fix it!!!

* **This class explores a bunch of different topics** - You'll definitely need a Google account to do a lot of the work, so if you don't have one you should create one (and if you don't want to use your current one, you might want to create one for this class).

* **I'd love to meet you** - Please plan on scheduling a meeting with me via video chat. Don't do it now, but you will have the opportunity to schedule a meeting during one of the first chapters in this course.  Also, if you have questions, email me. Or video chat me. Or Discord me. Or whatever! We do have a Discord for the Computing Sciences department here at FLCC and you'll have the option of joining it once the class starts.
