There are many stakeholders in education. In a school district, the stakeholders include the faculty and staff, the administration, the students, the parents or guardians, and the community at large. It's easy to overlook the role the community plays (in addition to paying taxes that fund the school, that is), but members in the community that are not affiliated with the school can offer input, provide guidance (School Board members), assist with clubs and activities (FIRST Robotics and musicals, for instance), and attend events (sports and drama productions). It is important to communicate with all the stakeholders, although that communication probably looks different based on the audience.

There's a good chance that the methods of communication have changed dramatically from when you started school in kindergarten and when you graduated as a senior. If you graduated in 2022, you were probably in kindergarten around 2009 or 2010. That means there is a solid chance that you and your parents weren't using apps (the iPhone first came out in June of 2007!).

Now think about your senior year. Did you use Remind? Microsoft Teams? Email? Text notifications? How did your parents get notified? It was probably a merry mix of text alerts, district newsletters, parent portals.

At FLCC, you probably get the bulk of your communication from Brightspace and email. Many students are in group chats with their classmates. As you go through this chapter, think about how you crave communication, how you receive communication, and how you create communication.
