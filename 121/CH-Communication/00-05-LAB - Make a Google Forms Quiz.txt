Chances are that you've used a Google Form before. They are great for collecting information from people (with out without a Google account). They are easy to make and the simplicity makes the tool very simple to use. 

But did you know Google Forms can be used to make quizzes, too? It might not have all the features of full-blown quiz software, but it's pretty dang good! 

Watch this video for a tutorial on how to use a Google Form as a quiz. Your job will be to make a quiz using Google Forms and send me the link so I can take it :)

A few things to be careful of:

1. Make sure you go to the settings and convert the Forms to a Quiz *before* you start making the questions.

2. Make sure you require an email address and configure the quiz so that quiz-takers will get a copy of their submission sent to their email.

If you have any questions, just ask!
