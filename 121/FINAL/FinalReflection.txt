^^ FINAL REFLECTION

^= =

# Description

The final project for the class this semester is a reflection. Similar to the journals, you will be creating a reflection that represents your honest, unfiltered response to this class.

I won't even read these until May 18, so they can have no effect on any work that is already submitted. I want you to be honest (like most of you have been in your journals!). 

This is as much for you as it is for me. I want to know how (if at all) this class has informed how you might teach. I also want to know how this course can be enhanced.

Please, be honest.

As with your journals, as long as you meet the specifications for this reflection, you'll receive full credit.

Please don't pad your response with fillers. I want you to really explore the totality of your experience this semester, and 2 pages is not a lot of room to do that in.
