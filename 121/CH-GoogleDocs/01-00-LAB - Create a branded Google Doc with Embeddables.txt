We're going to take some of the things we've made this semester and *embed* them into Google Docs! This is exciting because *if you change the original item, it can be easily updated in Google Docs*! The items we will be embedding are:

* Avatar (Google Drawings)
* Document Header (Google Drawings)
* Parent Time (Google Sheets)

At the end of the video I demonstrate how you can update all the items at once. Note that for this experience you don't have to modify any of your original pieces (but you can if you want to!).

You can also [check out the final produce here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQ7yLN81LpBz0SiLlD4K9piJRLH9fxeQj6qCpY2hNq4/preview).

If you have any questions, just ask!
