One way to make your expectations clearer to students (and to expedite your grading) is to create a Google Doc that laser focuses in on specific areas.

You can do this a number of ways, but one of the most interesting ways is to use a 1x1 table as a place for students to put their responses. 

This is handy for guided instruction (for instance, students responding to questions as they watch a movie or work on a project).

In this experience, we will be changing the background color of a Google Doc and inserting tables after prompts to help guide students in their responses.

If you have any questions, just ask!
