^^ LAB - Create a Favicon

# Description

A *favicon* is a graphical representation of a website; it is an icon that helps solidify your branding. 

Consider the following favicon examples below.

* The left favicon is for my personal site and uses the primary colors that signify simplicity and Google - they also make my initials.

* The FLCC Professional Development Hub uses the FLCC green and red and also a graphic of interlocking to show a balance of interconnectedness. 

* The FringeEdTech favicon is declarative - just the words "fringe educational technology".

* In the EmbeddedEducation favicon again we see the primary colors mixed together making an "e".

* The PhishingDemo.org favicon is circular and has a fish pondering whether or not it should go after a hook.
