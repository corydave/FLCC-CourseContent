^^ LAB - Set Up a Google Site for this class

# Description
A *Google Site* is a tool Google makes that lets us make sweet, responsive websites without any code. It has a "drag and drop" interface for easy use and handles much of the design work for us.

We will be building a portfolio using Google Sites during this semester; this step sets up the basic framework. You might find that down the road you can use this portfolio as a showpiece during a job application process. Or maybe you'll use it as evidence for consideration to an academic program. Or perhaps you'll just use it as a repository for cool tools that you can draw from later.

I'm building my site right along with you. My current progress is right about where your progress is. [Check it out for reference!](https://sites.google.com/view/mr-ghidiu/home)
