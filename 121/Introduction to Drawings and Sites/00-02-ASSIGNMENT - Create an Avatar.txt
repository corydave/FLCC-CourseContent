An *avatar* is a depiction of yourself that is oftentimes an illustration and does not necessarily have to mirror your physical presence.

Avatars generally convey how you see yourself and can include fantasy elements like fangs, elf-ears, wings, stylized hair, or whatever else you'd like to broadcast to the world.

A prolific thought leader in the educational technology space is Kasey Bell from [Shake Up Learning](https://shakeuplearning.com/). Here's her avatar:
