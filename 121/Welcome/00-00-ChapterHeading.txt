Welcome to the *most awesome semester ever!* I mean, sure. This fall there are sweet things to do. Trips to take. Sights to see. BBQs to be had. But then there's a whole new level. This class. Portal. Please make sure you check out a few things before getting started.

* Welcome to Technology in Education!
* Welcome Video
* Course Outline

There is also a sub-folder called **Course Information**. In this folder you'll find resources that might help you throughout the semester. This includes things like the invitation to Discord, a place to give me feedback, the Student Hours schedule, and some other cool things.
