^^ ASSIGNMENT - Create a desktop publishing project with Google Slides

^= =

# Description
This week we're going to use Google Slides as a desktop publishing program. There are a few different concepts we'll explore:
* Order (layers)
* Grouping
* Aligning (and distributing)
* Canvas versus "staging area"

If you've used Google Slides before to make presentations, that's great! It's perfect for that. But it's also great for desktop publishing (that is the term we use for designing publications).

Here is a [sample of a poster made with Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RpD_wGOv0Aenujh1VRhA64QEdTbdS4NN-8YXov5iH-U/edit#slide=id.p) - it's four feet by three feet and was used at a presentation.

You can also check out this [8.5" x 11" handout made with Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14vArz5He40B1gh-T4fgyX2lHLL3tQ2j5CUoKhc4gxUw/edit#slide=id.g19385e270b_0_1183) (for a game about robots).
