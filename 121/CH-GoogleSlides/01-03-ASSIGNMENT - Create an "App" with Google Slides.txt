^^ ASSIGNMENT - Create an "App" with Google Slides

^= =

# Description
One interesting (and easy!) way for kiddos to make actual apps is to use Google Slides. Alice Keeler (over at [Shake Up Learning](https://shakeuplearning.com/blog/how-to-create-your-own-apps-with-google-slides-free-template/)) has proposed using Google Slides as a convenient, easy way to make an app. Even the kiddos can do it!

Instead of a video tutorial for this experience we're going to use her blog as a guide to try and make an app. 

You can [find instructions here](https://shakeuplearning.com/blog/how-to-create-your-own-apps-with-google-slides-free-template/). Note that your final product does not have to look like Alice's - you have a lot of latitude to design what you want. Ideas include:

* An app that has links to things a student might want (like the school calendar, school hours, tutoring information, etc.).

* An app that is like a game and has tiles with animal names - when you press the button/tile, an animal pops up.

* Anything else you'd like!
