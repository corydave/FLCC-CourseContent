Infographics are a wonderful way to display information in a way that is easy to understand. Although they sometimes get a reputation for being too flashy and trite, when done properly an infographic is really effective at conveying complex ideas such as processes and numerical relationships.

There are some sites like [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), [Piktochart](https://piktochart.com/), [Vennage](https://venngage.com/), [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/), and [Adobe Creative Cloud Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/create/infographic) that help you make infographics. The benefits of these sites are that they have templates you can use and tools specifically tailored for making infographics.

But there's a down side - you don't necessarily have the ability to edit (or share) a document if it lives in another platform. Or there might a cost associated with it. Or the freemium model doesn't have great features.

Because of this, I think it's a smarter move to learn how to use Google Slides as an infographic design platform. You can always come back and edit it. You can always make a copy of it. You can always share it.

In this video, I'll create an infographic from scratch using Google Slides. Be sure to check out the examples below for inspiration on creating *information* infographics. The walkthrough in the video will look at making a *process* infographic. 

Make sure you check out the rubric for this assignment - there is a lot going on behind the scenes here! If you haven't done the Google Slides experience where we look at desktop publishing concepts, you should probably do that first. 

If you have any questions, just ask!
