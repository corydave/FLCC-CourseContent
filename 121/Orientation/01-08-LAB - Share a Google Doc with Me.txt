Throughout this course, there will be assignments that require you to make a copy of a Google Doc, do some work in it, and then submit the link to me. It's mission critical that you set the sharing permissions such that **[Anyone with the link can comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGXfLDctcI)**. Otherwise I might not have access to the document ðŸ˜¥.
