^^ LAB - Share a Google Doc with Me

# Description

^= =

Throughout this course, there will be assignments that require you to make a copy of a Google Doc, do some work in it, and then submit the link to me. It's mission critical that you set the sharing permissions such that **[Anyone with the link can comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGXfLDctcI)**. Otherwise I might not have access to the document üò•.

This assignment is your first taste of that! Read the steps below; you'll copy a Google Doc, make some changes, shared the document, and then submit the link to me in Brightspace. This video walks you through each step üòÅ.
