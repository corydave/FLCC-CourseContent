# Description

[Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-SS3BpBd8vE_6HERIqf-wuCO2khSy6Wf_viSPfujDYE/copy) to make a copy of the Google Doc I have prepared for you. All it says in the doc is "SOMETHING COOL". 

Your task is to put something cool in the Doc and share it with me. This assignment should help you contextualize how many assignments will be submitted in this class.

1. The process of copying a Google Doc.

2. The process of sharing a Google Doc so that anyone with the link can comment.

3. The process of pasting a link into Blackboard.

4. The process of resubmitting work.
