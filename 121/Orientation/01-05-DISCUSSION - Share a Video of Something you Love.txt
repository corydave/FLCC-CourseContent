# Description

We want to know what type of media you enjoy! Do you like movies? TV shows? Comic books? Anime? Tabletop games? Haunted dolls?

Share one thing you like doing. But here's the catch - it needs to have an *embedded* YouTube video. It could be a clip from a TV show you like. It might be a movie trailer. It could be an unboxing video of a rare comic book that you like. Or maybe a play through of a tabletop game.

No matter what it is you decide to share, post it! And you should be reading posts from other students in the class, too, and commenting on at least one other.
