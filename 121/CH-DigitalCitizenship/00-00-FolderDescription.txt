"Digital Citizenship" is the responsible use of computers by users. That's a very broad responsibility! Digital citizenship means being vigilant about discerning information. It means protecting your privacy. It means guarding your secrets (like passwords!). It means contributing to digital society *in a responsible manner* (for instance, not being a bully).

New York State Department of Education has identified and rolled out five **Computer Science and Digital Fluency Learning Standards** for schools:

1. Impacts of Computing
2. Computational Thinking
3. Networks & System Design
4. Cybersecurity
5. Digital Literacy

Note that *digital citizenship* isn't explicitly called out in the state standards for digital fluency. That is okay because *digital citizenship* and the NYS standards for digital fluency share quite a bit of DNA. [Cypher Learning](https://www.cypherlearning.com/resources/infographics/neo/the-9-elements-of-digital-citizenship-your-students-need-to-know) identifies the following characteristics as essential for *digital citizenship*: access, commerce, communication, literacy, etiquette, law, rights & responsibilities, health & wellness, and security. 

Basically, no matter who you ask, *digital citizenship* can be boiled down to "understanding the risks and threats in the digital age and behaving in a safe, responsible manner."

In this chapter we will explore some tools and ideas you might want to use in your classroom as you champion *digital citizenship* with your students.
