There are a number of reasons to brand your classroom work. Perhaps you'd like to make it available on [TeachersPayTeachers](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/) (for free or for profit). Maybe you're obsessive about your work and you want it to look super sharp. Maybe you are interested in building a brand so you can be an influencer in the education space (like [Pocketful of Primary](https://www.pocketfulofprimary.com/)). 

But one really good reason is for your students. If you teach one subject (middle school, high school) then it's helpful for your students to be able to identify any of your handouts, assignments, and communications as *yours* just by a quick glance (parents appreciate that, too). And if you teach many subjects (early childhood education) then you might be interested in different branding for each subject so it is easier for kiddos to organize their work.

In this experience we'll be creating a header for our documents.

If you have any questions, just ask!
