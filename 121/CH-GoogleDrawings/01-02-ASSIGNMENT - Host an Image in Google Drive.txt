# Description

There are times when you might need to embed an image that lives somewhere else. Actually, later this semester we'll be doing just that (when we get to Twine).

But every now and then you might find yourself in a situation where you need to use an image - but you can't upload one. This is where Google Drawings can help!

This is a quick experience that will help us host an image to be used later.

If you have any questions, just ask!

# Specifications
* Please make sure you check the rubric to see what is expected.

* You must host an image in Google Drawings - there are no specifications for the content or image size.

* The Google Drawing title must be changed to reflect the content.

* The image proportions must not be skewed.

* The image must cover the entire canvas.

* The *published  URL* must be stored in a text box in the staging area of the Google Drawing (off on the canvas). Please do not submit this link in the assignment - this is for something later in the semester.

* Please paste a link to the Google Drawing (using "preview" in the URL instead of "edit" in the submission).

* Your Google Drawing must be shared such that [Anyone with the link can ***EDIT***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGXfLDctcI)
