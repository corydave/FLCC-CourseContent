^^ ASSIGNMENT - Create a Hot Spot Image in Google Drawings

^= =

# Description

A "hot spot" image is graphic that has multiple hyperlinks in it. Depending on where you click, you can direct the user to different places.

It is surprisingly easy to make hot spot images in Google Drawings - and this is super helpful for your students:

1. A "dashboard" where students can click on the websites they will be using

2. A "choose your own adventure" game

3. A multiple choice quiz

Your task is to check out the video and follow along! Make your own image with hot spots.
