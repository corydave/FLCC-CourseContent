How much do you know about images? Things like transparency, illustrations, .png vs .jpg, why iPhone images aren't web-friendly, and how to make an avatar?

In this chapter, there are a few experiences where we will dig into the different kind of images you will most likely find yourself working with. We'll also be making an avatar. And a website logo (favicon). And we'll start to explore Google Sites.

Let's go!
