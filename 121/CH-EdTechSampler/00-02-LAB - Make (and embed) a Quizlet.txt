[Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) is a tool that lets you make flashcards.

Teachers can use it to create study aids for students (it has been shown that interleaving is a very effective way of studying, and flashcards that embrace interleaving are an easy way to leverage this). 

Students can make flashcards too. Some teachers might actually create a set of flashcards and have each student create flashcards to add to the set.

Your job is to make a set of flashcards that cover a specific topic of your choosing. You must have at least six cards and at least one of them must include an image.
