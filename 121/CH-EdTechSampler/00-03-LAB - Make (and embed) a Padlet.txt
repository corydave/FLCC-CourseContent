[Padlet](https://padlet.com/) is a curation tool that looks similar to Pinterest. Pinterest is a great tool, but users cannot access most of the content without having an account, so it doesn't work well for students. Padlet was one of the original Pinterest-like tools designed for educators, but they limited their free services so a lot of educators migrated to [Wakelet](https://wakelet.com/), which is a very similar tool.

The tutorial for this assignment is based on Padlet, but Wakelet has many of the same features, so if you'd rather use Wakelet, that's fine. After watching the tutorial below, create a board that has no fewer than four articles (with thumbnails).

Once it's done, embed the Padlet (or Wakelet) into your Google Site.
