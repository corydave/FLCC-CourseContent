**STEM**. Science. Technology. Engineering. Math.

Sometimes you'll see **STEAM** instead. The "A" stands for "Arts", and the paradigm is a bit different. STEM typically refers to the hard sciences whereas STEAM uses hard and soft sciences as an approach to understanding problems and solving them.

This chapter we will actually be focusing on computer programming (coding). Don't panic! Just because we're looking at *programming* doesn't mean we'll actually be using Java or C++ to make stuff. In fact, there is a huge movement now in "No-Code Platforms". The art of programming isn't the mastery of the language, it's the art of the algorithm; creating the process and thinking through the flow.

We'll start by reading about STEM. There's an optional podcast (it's short!), and then a video about [The Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us). This is something that many school districts do in the first or second week of December. It's an opportunity to engage kiddos in computer programming (in a fun and approachable way).

After that, we'll take a peak at Twine (cool software that let's you make Choose your Own Adventure games, for example).
