^^ LAB - TWINE Experience

# Description

Your mission is to create a Twine experience. You get to decide the modality.

* You can create an experience you've designed for your students (like making healthy decisions).
* You can create an example of an experience you would expect your students to create.

# Specifications

1. You need to have at least ten (10) passages (this can include the start).
2. You need to have at least three (3) decision points (a decision point has two or more options).
3. You need to include at least three (3) images.
4. You need to have at least one (1) video (embedding a YouTube video counts!)

# Fine print
* None of the images need to be created by you (though you can if you want). But you must credit the work when necessary (if you are using Pixabay or Unsplash, no need to give credit - but it's always a good idea to!
* You don't need to create your own video (but you can!). You do need to embed a video (YouTube or Vimeo, for example).

# How to submit
Make sure you "Publish to file" from Twine - that will automatically download an HTML file. That's the file you need to submit to Blackboard.

You will need to "zip" the file - Brightspace might not like `.html` files. To do that, you just need to right click on the `.html` file and choose "SEND TO" and then "Compressed Folder" or use 7-zip or WinZip to zip it.
