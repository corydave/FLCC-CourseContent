^^ VIDEO - The Hour of Code is Here

Before watching the two videos, check out the official [Hour of Code website](https://hourofcode.com/us). You can sign up to host a session in your school (you don't have to do that), but if you scroll to the bottom of the page you can read more about the Hour of Code.
