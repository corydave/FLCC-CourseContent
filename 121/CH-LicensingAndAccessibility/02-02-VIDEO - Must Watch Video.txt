^^ VIDEO - Must Watch Video

^= =

This is a tweet from Steve Saylor. He is blind. And he plays video games ([his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/SteveSaylorsnowball) is quite prolific - he has reactions, reviews, and first impressions as he plays video games). Steve also [advocates for accessibility in games](https://www.vice.com/en/article/akzgwb/blind-gamer-steve-saylor-is-fighting-for-accessibility-in-video-games).

In June of 2020, one of his videos went viral - it was a reaction to the game "The Last of Us 2". You don't have to be familiar with the game to appreciate his two minute video; all you need to know is that he has been fighting for years to get more accessibility features in video games and that The Last of Us 2 delivered the best accessibility features in a game. 

Full stop.

There are probably lots of examples of accessibility that I could have included here - a lot of pieces that relate to schools, classrooms, and students. But I chose this one for two reasons:

1. Accessibility is oftentimes an afterthought. The potency of accessibility done right should resonate with you. It should be haunting. And this two minute video does that.

2. Accessibility isn't an education issue; accessibility is a societal issue that extends to every domain.

Hopefully you can take away how important accessibility features are for people who need them. And remember this for when you develop your own materials.
