The reading for this chapter is the Course Information Sheet (also known as the Course Outline or Course Syllabus). Yeah, I know. It's boring. Like, real boring. I tried to jazz it up. It will make you laugh. It will make you cry. It might make you laugh again.

Here's the big takeaways:

<div style="margin-left:220px;">

* The **late work policy** is new this semester. Please read it carefully.

* Work is due on **Wednesdays** at **noon**. Please make sure you plan accordingly.

* This course is a pretty novel experience. You'll see a lot of new things in here - keep an open mind and always feel free to contact me! I know this class may challenge your comfort level - but that's kind of the point üòÅ.

* The first part of the Syllabus is specific to this class. The second part of the Syllabus contains elements you've probably seen before in other classes as they are relative to FLCC. You might want to read through this part, too, as the information may have changed.
