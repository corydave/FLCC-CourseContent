First we will examine the main tenets of copyright (including fair use and royalty-free). Then we'll look at alternatives (such as public domain and Creative Commons. There are a *ton* of images, illustrations, movies, music, and other assets out there that are not only legal for you to use, but also legal for you to *modify*!

It is really important to note that it is *super easy* to be in violation of copyright law. The best piece of advice I can give educators is to never, *ever* right click on an image and choose "Save image as". That is the textbook definition of copyright infringement. Even if you don't think you'll ever get caught, it does set a poor example for your students.

Therefore, I *highly* recommend using assets that are in the public domain or are shared under the Creative Commons (or similar) license.
