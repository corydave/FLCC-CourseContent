^^ ASSIGNMENT - Making a presentation using Creative Commons items

^= =

# Description

In this experience, we'll be making a Google Slides presentation using nothing but copyright-free assets. Don't worry if you've never used Google Slides before - the video walkthrough shows every single step.

### STEP 1: Get a topic
Pick a topic you’d like to make a mini-presentation on (it can be anything you’d like - in the video I chose the topic "Octopus"). Your mini-presentation is only going to be a few slides, but it needs to contain images, text, and a video.

### STEP 2: Get a copy of the template
[Click here to get a copy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xO4xmA94gCcuymfSfpMvcLBul1mRfEhJq3M6nsnC3rY/copy) (you must be logged into Google).

### STEP 3: Create the presentation
The presentation should reflect the topic you chose and make use of the items you found licensed by Creative Commons. You need to include all attributions (the license type as well as the artist and source) that are hyperlinked to the asset.

Be sure to include three images (from at least two different sources), one video, and some text. All these assets need to be copyright-free. The video walkthrough shows some sites that might be helpful.

### STEP 4: Submit your work
Make sure your Google Slides presentation is shared such that ["Anyone with the link can COMMENT"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGXfLDctcI) and paste the link into the Brightspace submission.
