^^ ASSIGNMENT - Google Doc Accessibility WebQuest

^= =

# Description

After the reading about accessibility and watching the videos, hopefully I've done a good job of establishing the landscape of why it is important to provide accessible content. 

Hopefully you are also equipped with some tools to help you create accessible materials.

This is a WebQuest. Yes, I know that is such an outdated term. But this experience is kind of like a WebQuest. 

Here's the deal - you'll be making a copy of a Google Doc. There are a few different things you'll have to research (questions 1-6). The video walkthrough here does not cover that part. 

But the last few questions (7-10) ask you to make the document accessible (the walkthrough video *does* show how to do that).

Make a [copy of the Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/190f1DAIFPh-2wobhH8oqrUJ4I0yMCTGwGfbVu1SaAdA/copy) and then get to work ðŸ˜„!

# Specifications

* Change the name of the Google Doc to include your name.

* Add your name *in* the Google Doc, next to "NAME".

* Answer questions 1-6 with your own thoughts. You can totally use any resource you want for this - even resources outside of the readings and videos (use Google if you'd like).

* For questions 7-10, you'll be tasked with doing different things in the document (like ALT tags and styles). Do those things :)

* Share the document so that "Anyone with the link can comment". Copy the link and paste it here in the "WRITE SUBMISSION" portion.

* Have a nice day!
