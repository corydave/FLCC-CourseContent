^^ JOURNAL - Google Sheets Reflection

# Description

Google Sheets (and Microsoft Excel) can be intimidating. It's probably the least used software in Google Workspace because it seems overwhelming. 

Formulas. Formatting. Conditional formatting. Equations. Tables. Rows. Columns. Grid lines. Lots of confusing things.

## Reflect on your experience.

This chapter was designed to delicately introduce you to the cool features of Google Sheets. I'm curious about two things - 

1. Did you extract any value from any of these experiences?

2. Do you envision yourself using any of the things you learned in your teaching career?


<br />

### Here is my response:

<br />

I actually like Google Sheets for a lot of different reasons. Unlike Docs, it is easy to organize information in a rigid format (Docs has tables, but they are a bit cumbersome to use - even with the new changes they've made in the software). 

The *conditional formatting* in Sheets is pretty cool - it's nice to be able to change the color (or other formatting) of a cell based on criteria (for instance, red for absent, green for present). I wind up using this quite a bit when I teach. I DO find that I don't need attendance sheets much when I teach online, but the conditional formatting tool is quite nice for other things (I like to make TO-DO lists for organizing my teaching tasks).

I'm also a fan of formatting. It is *so freakin' easy* to make sweet looking tables! I know I can create a table in Sheets and easily link it in Docs (I can't wait to show you that later this semester - you're gonna love it!).

One more thing I like about Sheets is the ability to make lists, tasks, and just have a place where I can record some thoughts that need hierarchy. Yeah, I know I can do that in Docs, but it's pretty slick in Sheets. 

Oh yeah - and formulas. Since I've been using Sheets/Excel for more than twenty years, I've gotten pretty good at it. I'm pretty sure that I can write a formula for whatever I'd like (though the ones I showcased in the videos are probably as sophisticated as I'd ever need them to be).

Every week, we will be reflecting on the things we learned. Typically this will involve software (and how it fits into the context of teaching), cognitive science (how learning works), or just visceral reactions. The intent of these journaling sessions are to help you recognize where the totality of your educational experiences have led you and how those experiences intersect with what we know about teaching and learning. The journal entries are private (you and I are the only ones reading them; they will not be shared to the class).

It is important to note that these journals are not assessed based on the content; I cannot assign you a grade based on your beliefs or your interpretations of what we learned. Instead, I am interested in the rigor of your curiosity. I want to know how what we talk about has informed your approach to teaching. If we are looking at software, how could you leverage that software in class? If we discuss learning science, how will you take what you know and transform it into killer educational experiences?

Each journal will have a unique prompt to it; your job is to respond with passion. Your job is to respond with questions. Your job is to respond with lofty ideas. FLCC is invested in creating a cadre of multidimensional thinkers that can leverage technology and curate phenomenal experiences for K12 students. Your job is to realize that mission by dedicating time to reflect.

I will read every entry and respond - please make sure you read my comments. These journals are symbiotic - I rely on your responses to gage the efficacy of the course. Your candid conversation may drive the direction of this class and inform future iterations of this course.
