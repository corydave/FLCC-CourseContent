Spreadsheets. Most people hate them. But they are such a potent tool! I use them to organize my classes (I have one spreadsheet for this class that has one tab for all the due dates. I have 11 other tabs, one for each chapter and it has all the assignments on it)

We'll be building two tools from scratch - an attendance form and also an interactive rubric. Oftentimes students ask what the purpose of this chapter is since there are tools that do both of these things already.

Please understand that I've been very deliberate with the tools used in these experiences. There's a chance your district will have software for making rubrics, for instance (although if your school *doesn't have a rubric tool* you'll be all set). But the skills needed to build the interactive rubric are transferrable to other arenas, too. For instance, the experience includes checkboxes, coloring font and cells, conditional formatting, etc.

There are video walkthroughs for both of these experiences üòÅ. If you have any questions, let me know!!!!

# Notes
There are two things to keep in mind:

1. Your school might use Microsoft Office instead of Google. That's OK - Microsoft Excel is similar enough that the skills you acquire here will transfer.

2. One of the most valuable things educators say they use Google Sheets (or Microsoft Excel) for is **mail merging**. It helps with seating charts, labels, and sending notes home to parents. We won't cover that in this class, but there are plenty of tutorials out there that you can explore when you're ready!
