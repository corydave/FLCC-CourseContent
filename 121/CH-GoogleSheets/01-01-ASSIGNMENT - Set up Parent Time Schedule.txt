^^ ASSIGNMENT - Set up Parent Time Schedule

^= =

# Description
One of the cool things about Google Sheets is the ability to make and customize tables. Even if you need to make a table in Google Docs, it's usually better to create it in Google Sheets and then copy it into Docs.

Today we'll build a simple table. This will be time that you will be able to meet with parents when you have a classroom. Later in the semester we will be putting this table into Google Docs. But for right now we'll just be creating it.

You can watch the video here and follow along! Note that the video doesn't tell you to hide the gridlines, but you will need to go to *View â†’ Show* and uncheck *Gridlines*
