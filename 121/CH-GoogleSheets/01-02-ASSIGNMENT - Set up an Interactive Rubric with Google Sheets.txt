^^ ASSIGNMENT - Set up an Interactive Rubric with Google Sheets

^= =

# Description
Rubrics are instruments that serve many purposes. Educators can use rubrics with assignments to manage expectations and provide a roadmap to their students. For a student, a rubric is a checklist of things that need to be included.

Rubrics are also used as an evaluative tool. When it comes time to grade work, a rubric helps to equalize the grading process (every student is measured across the same dimensions). Rubrics also provide an efficiency to grading.

In this experience, we'll be building an interactive rubric from scratch.
