^^ WEEK 02 - Midweek Check In

^= =

# Welcome to Chapter 2
I know it's a bit wonky since it's like the middle of the week yet we're staring a new chapter. But that's OK! That's how this class works. Work is always due on Wednesdays.

# Chapter 2 Overview
This week we'll start to build our portfolio (yeah, I'm building mine right along with you!). We have a few things going on this week:

1. Learn a bit about images (.png vs .jpg, for instance)

2. Make an avatar

3. Make a "favicon"

4. Start making a portfolio!

Don't panic - there are video walkthroughs for each of these experiences. There is also a journal at the end asking you to reflect on how your avatar and favicon represent you.
