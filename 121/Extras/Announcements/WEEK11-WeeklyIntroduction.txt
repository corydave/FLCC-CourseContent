^^ WEEK 11 - Weekly Introduction

# Laker Day
I hope you had a good Laker Day and took advantage of some of the offerings at the college (including TACOS!). Laker Day is always a good opportunity to recharge - please make sure that if you missed it this week you plan to attend next week).

# Google Sheets
Yup. We're diving into Google Sheets. There are two experiences in this chapter. I know there is nothing that sounds cool about Spreadsheets. But I'm hoping you change your mind a little bit after this chapter - Sheets is a *very* versatile tool!

Both of the experiences are in the course right now but you can't see the rubrics yet. I'll add them on Thursday :)
