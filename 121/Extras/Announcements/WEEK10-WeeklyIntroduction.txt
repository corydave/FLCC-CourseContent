^^ WEEK 10 - Weekly Introduction

# Chapters 4, 5 and 6

Hey folks - a few things. After talking to some students in the class, you can submit items from chapters 4 and 5. Here's the deal:
* The Pear Deck assignment may have been confusing for creating an account; FLCC doesn't appear on the list of schools in the zip code. You can manually enter **Finger Lakes Community College** and get an account.

* The Nearpod assignment cannot be submitted (but if you submitted it before it was due you can resubmit it).

* Any links to your embedded objects in chapter 4 can be resubmitted. If you *don't have the option to get a link*, you need to make sure you are using the *heading* style (if you have questions, email me!).

* Chapter 6 is due Wednesday, but you also have a two week grace period for that chapter.

# Next Chapter
The next chapter will have some assignments using Google Sheets. We're going back to the format where I make video tutorials that you can follow step by step.

# Week 10
I know it's long. And you might be tired. Ten weeks is a long time. Keep it up - the finish line is near!
