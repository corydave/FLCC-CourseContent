# Keep it up!
The work that I've seen so far for Chapter 2 is *insane*! It's so cool!!! Thank you for sharing your avatars and favicons with me!!! As a reminder, you'll want to to your journal entry this week as you are making your avatar and favicon (you'll be reflecting on *why* you made your favicon and avatar the way you did - how do they represent your online presence?).

#  Incognito mode
Don't forget you should test your Google Site (or any link, really) before submitting it by using *incognito mode*. In your browser, you can use the menu bar and select "Incognito Window" or "Incognito Mode". Then paste your link in the new window; if you can see the contents, I should be able to as well!

# Gratitude post
Thank you so much for working so hard, being patient while learning how this course works, and for meeting with me one-on-one. I know it's hard sometimes to carve out time to meet with me, and I appreciate it!
