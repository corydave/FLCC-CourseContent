^^ WEEK 05 - Weekly Introduction

# Continue your work
Although it's only Monday, I wanted to remind you that you don't have any work due this Wednesday. Remember that this current chapter is two weeks long!


# Grades
Hey folks - I know there are a number of assignments that haven't been entered into the grade book yet. One of the challenges of this high-touch course is that there are a lot of experiences. I assure you I'll have them done as soon as I can. I thank you for your patience!

Please note that work handed in late (but within the grace period) won't be graded as fast as work that was handed in on time.

# Need anything?
If you need *anything*, let me know. I'm here for you!
