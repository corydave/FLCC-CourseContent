^^ WEEK 02 - Weekly Introduction

^= = 

# Thanks
Thank you to everyone so far who has helped build the class community by participating in the Discussion and adding to FlipGrid. 

And thanks for an awesome experience so far!

# Apologies
In the Starfish notes I sent yesterday, I think I said that work was due on Mondays in this class. Work is NOT due Mondays. Work is due Wednesdays. My deepest apologies!

# What to expect
This week we'll be setting up a Google Site as your portfolio. On Wednesday, you'll see the next chapter become available. It will include a few things:

* A lesson on transparency in images (.png vs .jpg)

* A cool way to use Google Drawings to help make an avatar

* A lesson on what a "favicon" is

* A walkthrough to create a Google Site

# Grading
I graded almost everything that was submitted last week, but I see a large number of things came in today. I'll work my way through them! Remember that work is due on Wednesdays at noon, but please don't wait until Wednesday to do them :)

# Meetings
Thank you to all that I've met with already, and I'm looking forward to meeting with the rest of you in the coming weeks! One thing to keep in mind - Starfish has double booked me for most of the meetings! So if you try to log on to the Google Meet and I don't let you in immediately, just come back in 4 or 5 minutes please. The meetings don't last super long.
