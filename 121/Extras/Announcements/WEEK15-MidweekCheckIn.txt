^^ WEEK 15 - Midweek Check In

# Final Portfolio

This is the last week of the semester - it officially ends May 17! Just a reminder that no work will be accepted after May 17 (the 2-week grace period has limits, and one of those limits is the semester ending!).

I know not all work has been graded yet, but you can expect everything to be graded (with feedback) in the next week.

# Grades

All work in this class has been graded. If you think there is an error, you need to sort that out with me as soon as possible. I feel like there may be confusion in how grading works in this class:

* I have the feeling that some of you have not been reading the comments in the grade book - almost every zero in the grade book has comments on how you can resubmit your work and what to fix.

* If an assignment requires you to embed something in the Google Site, you *still have to submit a link to that in Blackboard* (otherwise, I won't know if something has been resubmitted and I can't grade it).

With that said, if you are still interested in resubmitting work (that is, any work you submitted and received a zero on *at any point in the semester*), you have until 11:59 PM on May 17 to do that. After that, I can't accept work. However, I will be posting the final grades in this class as soon as I can after May 17, so please stay tuned to your email because every now and then there is a little clarification that needs to be made.
