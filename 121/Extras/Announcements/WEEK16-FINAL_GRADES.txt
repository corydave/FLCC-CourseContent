^^ FINAL GRADES ARE POSTED!

# Thank you
Thank you for a wonderful semester. I was so so soooooo appreciative of the final reflections. I am thrilled beyond belief with all the good ideas you suggested. It's always interesting to read these final reflections, but the ones this semester were *by far* the most insightful one's that I've ever received!

# Final grades
Final grades are posted in Blackboard. If you observe any issues with your grades, you need to let me know as soon as possible. I will be submitting the grades Monday night at 5:00 PM.

# Thank you again
Again, thank you for being awesome!
