^^ WEEK 06 - Weekly Introduction

^= =

# What to expect this week
We're finishing up the previous chapter (which had five experiences). 

I'm about halfway through all the work that has been submitted, and I will try my hardest to finish it all in the next two days. Thank you for your patience!

# What to look out for
Don't forget that the way to submit each of the five artifacts is to embed them in your Google Site (and then submit a link for each artifact in Blackboard.

# What to expect for the next chapter
*Generative learning*. It's something I just learned about at a conference I'm at this week. Fingers crossed - this is going to be either a disaster or something beautiful.
