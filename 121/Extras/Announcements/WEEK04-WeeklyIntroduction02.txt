^^ WEEK 04 - Weekly Introduction [Part II]

# Welcome

This chapter is going to be a bit of a hodge-podge. My grandmother used to say that for dinner we were going to have Mustgos. I always thought that was a Romanian meal (she cooked a lot of Romanian food), but it turns out that "Mustgos" were just leftovers that needed to be eaten before they went bad. Mustgo night was just a random collection of everything in the fridge!

The tools we'll be looking at don't really fit into a chapter in this course, so the must go in one chapter that contains all sorts of random stuff. 

Please note that this does *not* diminish their importance; these tools are really potent! But we just don't dedicate a chapter to online quizzing tools (like Quizlet and Kahoot!) or screencaptures (like Screencastify and Loom) - although maybe we should.

The tools we'll be looking at:
* Quizlet
* Wakelet
* BookCreator
* Screencastify

We'll also be pondering how they could be used in our classrooms (in the Journal).
