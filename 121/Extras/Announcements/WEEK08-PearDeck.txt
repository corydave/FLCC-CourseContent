^^ Pear Deck Update

# Creating an account
There have been a few questions about signing up for an account with Pear Deck. Here's the deal - anytime you ever create an account for software in this class, you should create an educator account (you're going to be an educator after all!).

With that in mind, there have been a few questions about what school to sign up with as an educator. Here's the feedback from Pear Deck (I just heard back from them!):

^=,

Thanks for reaching out, and I'm sorry for the confusion regarding the signup process!

It's okay if you're not associated with a school. In that field, if you prefer, you can include a job title, or a different alternative in the School field. Once the form is filled out completely, you should then be able to click the red Connect to My School button and proceed with your account setup. 

Please let me know if you have questions or concerns.
