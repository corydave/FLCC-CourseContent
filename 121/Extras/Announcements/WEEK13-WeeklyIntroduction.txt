^^ WEEK 13 - Weekly Introduction

# Google Slides
As promised, this week we will be looking at Google Slides. You probably already have some experience with Google Slides (or Microsoft PowerPoint), but we'll be looking at Slides a bit differently this week.

The first experience will have us looking at common design and production tricks (layers, grouping, guides, and ordering). Those skills extend to other software, too (Google Drawings, Microsoft Word, etc.)

The second experience will have us making an infographic with hyperlinks.

# Grades
All submissions will be graded by the end of Wednesday!!!!
