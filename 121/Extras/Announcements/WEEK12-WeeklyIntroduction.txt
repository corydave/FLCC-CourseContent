^^ WEEK 12 - Weekly Introduction

^= =

# What's going on this week
Just like last week when we looked at Google Sheets, this week we'll be looking at Google Slides. There are two projects - making an interactive Infographic and making a Choose Your Own Adventure. 

Video tutorials for both will be posted!

# Grades
I am working hard to get the grades up to date (this includes the resubmissions from previous assignments). Thank you for your patience as I work through the work ðŸ˜ƒ.
