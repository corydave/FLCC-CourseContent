^^ WEEK 10 - Midweek Check In

# Current chapter
Given the announcement regarding chapters 4 and 5 earlier this week, I will continue to honor those past assignments. If you need more details, please check out the announcement :)

As far as what to expect for next week, that's when we'll be exploring Google Sheets. There are two lessons - making an interactive rubric (which demonstrates some of the interactive abilities of Google Sheets) and making an automated attendance (which shows off the formula and conditional formatting features).
