# Hi!

Just a quick note to say, "HI!".

The second Google Slides video will be posted and that will conclude the assignments for this class (other than your final project!).

# Final project

The final project will be posted Saturday.

# Late work

Please remember that the semester ends May 17 - that means you *need to have all your work in by noon that day*.

# May the Fourth be With You
