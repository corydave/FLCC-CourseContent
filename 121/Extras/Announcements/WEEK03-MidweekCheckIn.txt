# Welcome to Chapter 3
You. Are. Awesome.

Keep up the amazing work! Seriously!

# Chapter 3 Overview
Now we are going to turn our attention to copyright and accessibility. Both of these are <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">boring</span> super important! And actually can be really interesting. 

The big takeaways for me this chapter:

1. [unsplash.com](https://www.unsplash.com) is *awesome* for getting copyright-free images.

2. Don't design things with a mind for *accessibility* - go for *universal design for learning*.

There are some readings this chapter, some videos, and some experiences (with video walkthroughs!).

Your second journal entry is also part of this experience - as you are working your way through the content, think about your experiences as a student and if your teachers considered copyright and/or accessibility as design criteria.
