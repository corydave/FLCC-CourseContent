^^ WEEK 04 - Midweek Check In

# Welcome to Chapter 4

This chapter is spread across ***two weeks***. There is no work due on Wednesday, February 23!

There are essentially five projects (each one has a video walkthrough) and then you'll be posting each project in your Google Sites portfolio.

If you have any questions, please let me know! The first video shows you exactly how to embed each item *and* post the precise links from your Google Site.
