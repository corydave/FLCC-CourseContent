^^ WEEK 05 - Midweek Check In

# How ya doin?

Only a few things to mention folks:

* One of the book types in BookCreator does not have an option to make a back cover. If you chose that type of book, I won't take off if you don't have a back cover :)

* All assignments that have been submitted are almost all graded - I should be done by Monday at the latest.
