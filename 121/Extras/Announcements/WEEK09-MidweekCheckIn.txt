^^ WEEK 09 - Midweek Check In

Hey folks! *all grades will be in the grade book by Sunday night*. I'm almost done with one section and then I'll finish the second section. Just a reminder that assignments are eligible for submission up to 2 weeks after the due date. Note that if you submit something and need to resubmit it, you have two weeks after I grade the previous submission (so if something is due 4/1, you have until 4/15 to submit it. If I grade it on 4/16, you have until 4/30 to resubmit).

New content will be appear Wednesday :)

Enjoy the rest of your weekend!!!
