# Getting to know you

I'm enjoying the opportunity to get to know you. Thanks for posting in the Discussion and FlipGrid.

I've already met some of you one-on-one; thanks for setting up appointments! If we haven't met yet, I'm stoked to see you!

# Next Chapter
In the next chapter, we will be exploring Google Sites. We'll be setting up a website where you can house all the work you do for the rest of the semester. That content will be available on Wednesday, February 2 (Groundhog Day!).
