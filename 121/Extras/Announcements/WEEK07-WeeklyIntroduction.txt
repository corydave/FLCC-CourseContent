^^ WEEK 07 - Weekly Introduction

# Current unit
Hey folks - I haven't seen any questions about the most recent unit yet. Just a reminder - *please read the reading before starting the work*. While the reading doesn't really talk to the specifics of the experiences (Nearpod and Pear Deck), it *does* contextualize the *reason* for why this unit is a bit of an outlier.

Remember that when you're teaching you will certainly run into tech issues (software or hardware) that you'll have to muddle through. It's also incumbent on educators to constantly design better experiences for their students - and that often translates to figuring out new and exciting toys.

I know this might feel uncomfortable; I know you might not feel safe with no guardrails. But this is an approximation of what teaching is like!

# Chapter 4 and embedding
You may have noticed that there are a lot of zeros in the grade book for the five embedding activities (BookCreator, Screencastify, IORAD, Quizlet, and Padlet/Wakelet). ***For the most part, those are temporary!*** I did look at a number of those pieces, and many of them were *spectacular!* But they were submitted improperly, and that's actually a big mess on my end. The good news is that fixing this won't be too hard, so make sure you watch the video in this announcement.

I take responsibility for this, and I'm sorry. Normally when I'm going through an assignment, if I see one or two submissions that really miss the mark, I assume the instructions were clear. But when most people miss the mark, then it's my fault for not being clear. I'll rephrase the submission guidelines for next time and I'll have to rethink the messaging in the video tutorials. 


So really, this is my fault. But I didn't realize it was an issue until I was halfway through grading those assignments (some people *did* submit the proper way, but many did not). At that point, it was too late to go back and change. So please know that as long as you fix it in the next week (by Wednesday the 16), I'll regrade :)

If you want instructions on how to submit the assignments, either watch the first video in chapter 4 (start at the 6:45 minute mark) or watch the video included with this announcement.

# Grades
Everything that has been handed in has been graded! Please double check your grades and make sure they are aligned with what you think they should be. As a reminder, *please do not expect me to grade any work you email me*. If it is not submitted in Blackboard, I will not attach a grade to it. If you are experiencing technical issues with Blackboard, you can work with the [SUNY HelpDesk](https://online.suny.edu/help/). They are quick to respond and super helpful!

Don't forget there is a two week grace period baked into most experiences in this class. If you are constantly relying on that grace period, I'd suggest you work with the [Academic Success and Access Programs](https://flcc.edu/learningsupport/) to work on time management. Waiting until the last minute to work on these assignments is not good. It devalues your opportunity to learn meaningfully (seriously - cramming is proven to be a waste of your time - you're much better off working on things episodically), it causes you needless stress, and it oftentimes results in mediocre (at best) work.

# Thanks
I do want to thank you for being engaged in this course! Some of the journal entries are *unbelievable* and some of the work I've seen has been out of this world! I recognize that this class is required and there are a lot of people taking this class that would prefer not to, but the reality is that this is a *very critical course for your development as an educator*. I taught for eight years in K12, I was a technology coach, and I was on the school board for my local district (until my term expired last year). I can tell you with absolute certainty that technology skills are a determining factor in the hiring process.

I've worked with educators, administrators, and educational technology professionals designing this curriculum (and it still changes from semester to semester). I'm aware that it might seem boring, but please try to give a best faith effort in the work you do here; it will pay off later in your academic pursuits.
