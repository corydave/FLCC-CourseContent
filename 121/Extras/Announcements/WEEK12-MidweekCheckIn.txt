^^ WEEK 12 - Midweek Check In

# Check In
I know you were expecting the Google Slides to come out Friday, but I felt that there was a lot of... everything... going on. I heard from a few students who were super stressed (not only in this class, but from other classes, too). That usually means people can benefit from a mini-break. Enjoy the next two days. Google Slides comes out Wednesday😁.

Be well.

# Grades
Still working through grades - I appreciate your patience.
