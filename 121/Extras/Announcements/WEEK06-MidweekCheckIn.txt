^^ WEEK 06 - Midweek Check In

# Here's what is happening

The rest of the work for this current chapter will be posted today. I've also extended the due date for the work that *was* supposed to be done by Wednesday. I hope you have enjoyed the reading as it frames what we will be doing for the rest of the chapter. It's mission critical that you read it (which is why I haven't posted the assignments yet).

If you haven't read it, please do so today.

Thanks! And be well!
