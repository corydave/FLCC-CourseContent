# Topics for this chapter

Believe it or not, **measuring** can be a bit complicated. But it is necessary to be super exacting when dealing with things like blueprints and machining. It's also important to know what **tolerance** means and how to deal with it. For instance, do you know what this means?

<center><span style="font-family:courier, consolas, serif">± 0.005" | 0.13mm</span></center>

That is the *tolerance* of a cut with a laser cutter; this means the machine can reliably make cuts that are within 0.005" (or .13mm) of the intended cut. Note that the "±" means that the cut is accurate in either direction; that is, it might be up to 0.005" to the left of the cut line *or* to the right of the cut line. But the cut will be within that window.

* Measuring segment length

* Computing distance on a number line

* Absolute value

* Significant value, rounding, and tolerance

# To ponder

Before starting this chapter, see if you can answer these questions:

1. What does *absolute value* mean?

2. What is the *variance* of the *tolerance* of a cut?

3. What is the difference between the **metric system** and the **Standard system** of measurement?

4. What is length of this line segment, assuming the ruler uses the standard system?
