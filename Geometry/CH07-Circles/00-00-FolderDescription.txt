# Topics for this chapter

We're going to explore a bit more about circles in this chapter. Every circle has a **radius**, a **diameter**, and an infinite amount of **chord**s. 

In addition to looking at the anatomy of a circle, we'll check out **central angles** and **inscribed angles** as they relate to the **arc** (or part of the **circumference** of the circle. 

Lots of vocabulary? Yup. But don't worry, we'll get there!

* Area, circumference, radius, diameter, chords, secants, and tangents

* Arcs, central angles, and inscribed angles

# To ponder

Before starting this chapter, see if you can answer these questions:

1. How many degrees are in a circle? A **semi-circle**?

2. What does it mean when a circle has a **tangent**?

3. In the following diagram, circle c<sub>1</sub> has two tangents, AB and AC. If AB has a length of 8cm, what is the length of AC? How do you know?

4. In the following diagram, circle c<sub>2</sub> has inscribed &angle;ABC. If the measure of &angle;ABC is 40&deg;,  how many degrees are in arc AC?
