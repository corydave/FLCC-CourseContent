# Topics for this chapter

You probably know what a **right angle** is (a 90 degree angle, written as 90&deg;), and might remember what an **acute angle** is (smaller than 90&deg;) or an **obtuse angle** (greater than 90&deg; but less than or equal to 180&deg;). But do you know what a **reflex** angle is? How about **corresponding angles**? Or **vertical angles**?

Do you remember the difference between **parallel** and **perpendicular** lines?

In this chapter, we'll dig a bit deeper into all of these things.

* Types of angles

* Parallel lines and perpendicular lines

* Angle relationships

# To ponder

Before starting this chapter, see if you can answer these questions:

1. Consider the diagram below. If the measure of angle AED is 138&deg;, what is the measure of angle   DEB? What about the measure of angle CEB?
