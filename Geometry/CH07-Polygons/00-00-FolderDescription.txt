# Topics for this chapter

You probably are fairly familiar with shapes like triangles, squares, and rectangles. Maybe you recall that a **pentagon** has five sides. Or a **dodecagon** has twelve sides.

You might even have a mental model of a **perfect shape** - that is, all the sides are the same length (like a square). But *any* shape that has eight sides is an **octagon** (even if it doesn't look like a stop sign (that is, some sides are longer than others).

Let's dive a bit deeper on geometric shapes!

* Triangles

  * Isosceles, scalene, equilateral
  * Right triangles


* Quadrilaterals

* n-gons

* Perimeter and area

# To ponder

Before starting this chapter, see if you can answer these questions:

1. How many sides does a **hexagon** have?

2. What is the measure of the angle between any two sides in a regular hexagon?

3. Which of the following shapes have diagonals that are equal in length?
