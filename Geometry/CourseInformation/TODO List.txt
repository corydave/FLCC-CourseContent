^^ TODO for Instructor

# Here are things you need to do before teaching this class

## Touch Up "Start Here"

It's a good idea to review the content in "Start Here" and clean it up. Customize it so it is aligned with your teaching strategies. It's a good idea to provide an orientation about how this course will run, due dates, how students can contact you, and how the course is structured.


## Complete information for "My Instructor"

This section is currently not set up. You'll need to include your own personal information, contact information, a picture or video of yourself, etc.


## Author the Course Overview

This document lives in the ORIENTATION module and should provide information to the learner on what to expect. How will you be assessing their work (if you elect to do so)? What are the due dates? What is the level-setting in this course?

You should include:

* A mechanism that deconstructs the syllabus for learners in a clear and navigable way.

* A printable syllabus is available to learners (PDF, HTML).

* Links to relevant campus policies on plagiarism, computer use, filing grievances, accommodating disabilities, etc.

* Access to learner success resources (technical help, orientation, tutoring).

* Whether the course is fully online, blended, or web-enhanced.

* Appropriate methods and devices for accessing and participating in the course (mobile, publisher websites, secure content, pop-ups, browser issue, microphone, webcam).

* Course provides contact information for instructor, department, and program.

* Requisite skills for using technology tools (websites, software, and hardware) - for instance, [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/?lang=en), an actual compass and straightedge, graph paper, etc.

* Links to privacy policies for technology tools.

* Expectations for all course interactions (instructor to student, student to student, student to instructor) are clearly stated and modeled in all course interaction/communication channels

* Assurances that all tools and content are accessible (out of the box, this course is accessible).

* Criteria for the assessment of a graded assignment are clearly articulated (rubrics, exemplary work).

* Course grading policies, including consequences of late submissions, are clearly stated in the course information area or syllabus.


## Things you will need to do for interaction

* Provide regular and substantive instructor-to-student expectations, and predictable/scheduled interactions and feedback, are present, appropriate for the course length and structure, and are easy to find.

* Provide an opportunity for students to get to know you (a FlipGrid, a Discussion, One-on-One meetings, etc.)

* Provide activities intended to build a sense of class community, support open communication, promote regular and substantive interaction, and establish trust (e.g., ice-breaking activities, Course Bulletin Board, planned Office Hours, and dedicated discussion forums).

Provide an opportunity for students to provide feedback about the course.

## Establish your assessment mechanism

This course, by design, is self-paced and self-checked. There  is no structure for assessment. There are no due dates. I think a neat thing to do would be to record a video of you doing the REVIEW assignments in each chapter; the ASSESSMENT assignments are very similar and will give the student guidance. Also, remind students that drawings are drawn to scale when possible, but do not assume that they are exact (or even close - though they are ðŸ˜‰ )

## Each chapter has a stand-in video. 
You should change it to provide context for your students.

## Update CONGRATULATIONS video at the end of the course
This is the last item in the Course Content.Develop a way to determine when it will be used.

## Review all the content and adjust it as necessary.

Most of the content in this course is designed via Google 
Docs.

To replace a document in the course, first make a copy of the document and then paste the URL into **column H** in the Document Tracker. The HTML code to embed it will be automatically generated in **column J**. Replace that code with the code in the Blackboard page.
