Welcome to the class! Here's a few quick things you can do to get oriented to the course:

1. Click on **My Instructor** on the Course Menu (to the left) to learn about the instructor of this course.

2. Click on **Course Content** on the Course Menu to start exploring the wonders of Geometry!

3. Acquaint yourself with the **Are you stuck?** discussion (also on the Course Menu); this is where you can post questions that stump you. You should also wander into this discussion weekly to see if you can help other students and answer their questions.

If you have any questions, please email me!
