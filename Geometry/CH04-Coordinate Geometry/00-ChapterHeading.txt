# Topics for this chapter

Our first foray into geometry will be **coordinate geometry** - this is the form of geometry where we use graph paper (a **coordinate system** along the **x-axis** and **y-axis**). It's a good place to start because there is no abstraction; a line segment on my graph paper that starts at the point (1, 3) and ends at (5, 6) is *exactly* the same on your graph paper. 

One thing that is a little wonky is that we don't really consider whether the boxes on graph paper are one inch big, half an inch big, or three inches big; it doesn't matter. One box *is* the measurement. This helps us not worry so much about the **unit of measurement** (like inches or centimeters), rather we can focus exclusively on the relative size.

* Coordinate system
  * x-axis
  * y-axis
  * ordinate


* Distance

* Slope

* Pythagorean Theorem

* Dilation

# To ponder

Before starting this chapter, see if you can answer these questions:

1. Which axis is the x-axis? The y-axis?

2. What is an **ordered pair**?

3. Given the diagram below, what is the length of the line segment?
