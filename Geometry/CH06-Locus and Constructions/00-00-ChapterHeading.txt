# Topics for this chapter

The founder of geometry is the Greek mathematician [Euclid of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid). While his version of geometry was created over two 2300 years ago, his work (and the work of his followers) is still studied today. We call it **Euclidean geometry** (or **plane geometry**). This branch of geometry is probably what you are familiar with (for instance, triangles have 180&deg; and circles are 360&deg; around). 

There are other flavors of geometry that we don't study in this course (appropriately named **non-Euclidean geometry**). One of the cool things about Euclidean geometry is that we can use shapes and lines to represent ideas; it's unlike coordinate geometry in this regard. In this version, we don't need a coordinate system. If I draw a square on my paper and you draw one on yours, they may not look exactly the same. Mine might be bigger or smaller, but all the properties of a square still apply to both of our drawings.

* Point, line, ray, and segments

* Circles

* Triangles

* Quadrilaterals

* Perimeter and area

# To ponder

Before starting this chapter, see if you can answer these questions:

1. How many sides does a quadrilateral have?

2. What is the difference between **perpendicular** and **parallel**?

3. In the diagram below, which one is the **line**, which one is the **line segment**, and which one is the **ray**?
