^^ VIRTUAL POSTCARD #1

Hey folks! Happy weekend! I wanted to let you know I'm thinking about you. I try to send virtual postcards when I'm somewhere cool and remind you to take some time for yourself. 

This weekend I did some snowshoeing and hiking with a buddy of mine who works at SUNY. This virtual postcard is from Tinker Falls in Tully, NY. It's a super quick hike but the payoff is awesome!
