The reading for this chapter is the Course Information Sheet (also known as the Syllabus). Yeah, I know. It's boring. Like, real boring. I tried to jazz it up. It will make you laugh. It will make you cry. It might make you laugh again.

Here's the big takeaways:

<div style="margin-left:220px;">

* The **late work policy** is new this semester. Please read it carefully.

* Work is due on **Mondays** at **noon**. Please make sure you plan accordingly.

* I give out a lot of zeros during the first few weeks - there's a reason for that. It's in the syllabus!

* This course is a pretty novel experience. You'll see a lot of new things in here - keep an open mind and always feel free to contact me!
