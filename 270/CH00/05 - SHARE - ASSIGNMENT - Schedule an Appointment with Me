In your submission here, write in the "Write Submission" field. You should give me five dates and times when you can carve out 10 minutes to chat. When I read your dates, I'll pick a date and time that works for both of us and then I'll send you a link. All you need is a web browser or a smartphone. We'll be using Google Meet to meet :)

***Don't panic!!!*** These meetings aren't painful. I just wanna get to know you!!!

Please list your dates in times in order of preference. Pick a time before March 15. I'm up by 6:00am and available until 10:00pm most days. So your ranked choices might look something like this:

<div style="margin-left: 220px;font-weight:bold;">

February 2, 2pm

February 7, 8:30pm

March 8, 10:00am

March 2, 7:30am

February 16, 2:30pmÂ 

</div>

If we can't find a common time, I'll email you and we'll figure something out. Either way, expect an email from me after you submit this. And if you and I have already met before, I'd still like to see your beautiful face and smile again so please submit ðŸ˜¬ ).
