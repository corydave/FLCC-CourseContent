<br /><br />
It's a great way for all of us to get to know each other. To see how to post an entry, click the "Play" sign in the video directly above "Welcome! Introduce yourself!" (or check out [this video tutorial](207 Browns Meadow Ct NE, LEESBURG, VA 20176.)). If you can't see the FlipGrid, go directly to the website (https://flipgrid.com/8e581fd6) or download the app. Our "Flip Code" is 8e581fd6.
<br /><br />
The assignment is to post a short video where you tell us how to pronounce your name, something awesome about yourself, and where you live.
<br /><br />
Note that the "Student username" in this exercise is actually your first initial and last name mushed together (since my name in Blackboard is "Dave Ghidiu", my username is "dghidiu". If you have any issues with this, email me at dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu and I'll help you out!gree, and you'll have many classes with him in future semesters.</div>
