# DESCRIPTION

<div style="height:220px;"><img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTSZ-juIZZ3w4xS9zq89XGqn5PyF25UFt2iAWPVvE0ocMa47khHmzj55dzCTzweOYVCG6UBiKxH6Wyb/pub?w=200&h=200" alt="A chat bubble indicating conversation or discussion." style="margin: 0pt 10pt 10pt 0pt;float:left;"  />Here's your chance to introduce yourself to everyone else! Where are you from? What are you excited about this semester? What do you enjoy doing in your free time?
 
While you're at it, we all have different needs and wants when it comes to our working stations at home. Some of us love having mechanical keyboards. Some of us love gaming chairs. Some of us prefer sweet headphones. Some of us don't have any preference - we just want a quiet place. Some of us want standing desks.

This is a chance for you to help us understand who you are! Post a picture of where you do your work. Tell us what you like about it. Tell us what you wish was different. Tell us if you think it's a good place to be doing schoolwork - maybe it's not, and you can identify why!

You should spend some time looking at posts from other people. Tell us what you really like about what you see in other people's posts.

# SPECIFICATIONS

* You should embed an image of your workspace, not attach it. If you don't know how to post an image in Blackboard, [check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thaco45FgE).

* If you have an iPhone, you might wind up storing your photo as an HEIC file. This file is not supported by most web browsers, so you'll have to convert it to a more common format like JPG or PNG before embedding it.
