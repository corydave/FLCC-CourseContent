^^ QUIZ - Orientation

Every chapter starts off with a reading. The book for this course is free and available as a PDF or a Google Doc. But for this first chapter, the reading is the Course Syllabus.

The reading for this class is meant to be informative, relevant, and not-awful-to-read. Most of the chapters in this class have about 15 pages of reading, and it can be somewhat dense at times. Please make sure you do the readings!

Every chapter also has a quiz based on the reading. You need to score an 80% or better on the quiz to see the rest of the content in the chapter. 

Don't worry! You can take the quiz as many times as you'd like
This quiz has questions covered in the orientation videos and the course syllabus. You should review the syllabus and watch the videos before taking this quiz.
