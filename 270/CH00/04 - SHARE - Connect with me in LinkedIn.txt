^^ SHARE - Connect with me in LinkedIn

# DESCRIPTION

<div style="height:220px;"><img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQC7X7LtrKUVzUvcdX6nKPLsd1Yk9gfX_7TgZHZ8AHGppfTEcbqi4loH-LuV9mcbwn5PhDzjOJi-QHT/pub?w=200&amp;h=200" alt="The LinkedIn logo. A blue square with rounded corners and, in white, modern text, the letters 'in'." style="margin: 0pt 10pt 10pt 0pt;float:left;"  />If you do not have a LinkedIn account, you'll need to make one. LinkedIn is a social networking site for professionals.
The longer you have an account (and the more active you are), the more likely you are to be visible to potential
employers. We will all be summarizing and sharing articles in almost every chapter this semester, so it's important
that you have an account. You need to CONNECT with Jonathan Weissman and myself. Jonathan is the Program
Coordinator for the Networking & Cybersecurity degree, and you'll have many classes with him in future semesters.</div>
