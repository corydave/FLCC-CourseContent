As you've been watching video clips and reading about social engineering, hopefully you've been
parsing the content for subtle tips on how social engineering works. Your task here is to create
a scenario that relies on social engineering.

You should tell a small story here. Be creative. Spend some time designing a scenario that is
plausible and draws on a few social engineering tips.

Your scenario should be fun to read, easy to understand, and showcase an understanding
of social engineering. Most successful scenarios lean on a few tenets:

<div style="margin-left: 220px;">

* They are not 5-6 sentences (short submissions do not tell a story or paint a picture; they merely list a few facts)
* They should be engaging. A work of believable fiction.
* They should not rely on any unbelievable actions. For instance, please don't include things like, "I then hack into the victim's computer and install malware". Remember - this is about *social engineering*, not hacking.

This is a Discussion Forum, so you'll be able to respond to the scenarios that your classmates
make if you'd like.

# SPECIFICATIONS

* Your post should be coherent, logical, and not rely on digital hacking - it's only about hacking the person.
* You may (but do not need to) respond to posts from other students and say what you like about their post.
