^^ ANNOUNCEMENT - 2020-01-17 - 0900

# Welcome

I'm so stoked that you're part of this class! This is my favorite class to teach (don't tell students in my other classes!). 

Buckle your fun-seatbelts, this is going to be an awesome rideüòÅüéâ!!!

Even though classes don't start until January 24, you can *totally* poke around this class. Here's the main things you should check out:

* **Start Here** - Check out the course navigation menu on the left. There's a sick video. It's üî•.

* **Course Information** - All the boring stuff for the class (albeit stuff you need to know). The course syllabus will be available starting Tuesday at 9:00 AM (I'm putting on the finishing touches), but all the other content is there. 

* **Course Content** - YES! All the course content is available there. Well, *almost everything*. The last three chapters are still being developed (the infoSec sector moves at breakneck speeds, so we're putting the finishing touches on the last three chapters). But you can (and should!) start exploring.

    * *Current Experiences* includes Chapter 0 - the introduction and orientation. You should go through there right now.

    * *Upcoming Experiences* includes all the future content; things we'll be exploring later on this semester. But you can get a head start on it now if you want.

If you need anything this week, email me at dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu and I'll get back to you!

One last thing - the Course Navigation Menu on the left will be changing in the next day or two - please make sure you check out the latest and greatest version in the next 24-48 hours!

BE WELL! And let's be careful out there!
