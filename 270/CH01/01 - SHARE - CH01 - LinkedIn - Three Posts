Your job here is to find three articles that relate to INFORMATION SECURITY.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• You must summarize the article in 3-5 sentences and post them in LinkedIn

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Use the hashtags **#LetsBeCarefulOutThere** and **#flcc270**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• You should not tease the article; that is, you should not be providing clickbait

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• You absolutely should be providing spoilers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The people who read your summary should learn something; there should be a few takeaways

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• You should have 2 or 3 specific examples from the article

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Provide a genuine, short summary

If your post is merely a restatement of the title of the article, you have not succeeded in helping the
reader of your post learn anything.

Here are examples of posts that provide absolutely no value to the reader:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Read this article to learn some new ways to enhance your security online

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• This article explains how to properly dispose of files you don't need anymore

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Learn how to make a proper password

Now look at this example of a good post. Note that it provides a lot of examples from the article and that
it has some contextualization. But most importantly, the post pictured below provides actionable
takeaways to the people reading it.

The summary is meaningful and provides lots of actionable items and good ideas." /></p>
</center>

You should submit links to the posts in this assignment. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•  A good way to test the accuracy of the link is to copy and paste it into an "incognito" browsing session

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Please leave links to the posts in the WRITE SUBMISSION portion of the Blackboard submission, not the COMMENTS section

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Please do not number your posts; three links is sufficient (and preferred)
