In the last chapter, you created a LinkedIn profile. This time, we're all going to connect with each other! This will help you grow your network as well as share information you find with others. There are three steps to this process:

<div style="margin-left: 220px;">

* Find and copy the link from your LinkedIn profile
* Paste the link in this Discussion
* Connect with everyone else in the class

</div>


Note that you *do* need to share the link to your LinkedIn profile, but you do not have to CONNECT with your peers (but it's a good idea to!).
