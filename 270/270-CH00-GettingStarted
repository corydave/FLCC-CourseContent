## Course Information

In the left navigation bar in Blackboard (if you don't see it, poke around - it's probably collapsed but clicking on it will reveal the bar).

Please make sure you spend some time to read the Course Information Sheet (also called the Syllabus). There is a LOT of information in there; it's pretty important that you understand the flow of this class.

## Discord

Join the Discord server for FLCC Computing Science students!Â You don't have to - it's optional - but it's really fun.

## Content for Course

All the content for the course is already posted in the **Course Content** portion of this class. You are more than welcome to work ahead if you'd like.

Generally speaking, each chapter flows like this:
* **Read the chapter** (for the most part, the book was written by me and some of the past students). Don't worry! It's meant to be conversational and relevant. If you have ideas about the book, lemme know! I'd love to improve the book!

* **A quiz about the reading.** You need to get an 80% or higher to see the rest of the stuff (the fun stuff!) in the chapter. You can take the quiz as many times as you'd like.

* **Labs.** This is where the fun is! We'll be exploring thirty to forty labs this semester. Actual hands-on practice with information security concepts! You'll need Linux for some of these, but *don't panic!* We spend time in the first and second chapter getting Linux up and running. Even if you *can't* run Linux on your computer, there are tools online that you can use.

* **SHARE.** These are assignments when you share your knowledge with others. Sometimes this means writing questions that people will see on a test. Sometimes this means summarizing some cool articles in a post on LinkedIn.

^^ tl;dr

Check out the Course Information Sheet/Syllabus. Your teacher seems cool. Join Discord If you need something, let him know. Let's be careful out there.
