^^ FINAL GRADES ARE POSTED!

# Thank you
Thank you for a wonderful semester!!!! It's over! You did it!

Good luck in future classes (if this isn't your last semester) and your careers! If you need anything, let me know!

# Final grades
Final grades are posted in Blackboard. If you observe any issues with your grades, you need to let me know as soon as possible. I will be submitting the grades Monday night at 10:00 PM.

# InfoSec Reports
I was hoping to compile all the InfoSec reports and release them, but I made a tactical error when I posted the assignment - I did not specify Google Docs. So I have *a lot* of submissions that are in PDF or Word, and those are too hard to work with. ðŸ˜¢

# Thank you again
Again, thank you for being awesome!
