^^ WEEK 10 - Midweek Check In

# Current chapter
I hope you are enjoying this chapter! It really is one of my favorites. I think I love it because you don't really need to be proficient with hacking tools and technical computer software to be able to perpetrate a hack.

The next chapter is THE LAW, and it's got a lot of research in it. Stay tuned! Then the last chapter - Secure Software Design.

Lemme know if you have any questions.
