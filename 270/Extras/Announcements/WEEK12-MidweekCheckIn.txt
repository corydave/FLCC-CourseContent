^^ WEEK 12 - Midweek Check In

# Check In
I blew it! I didn't have the Google Form for questions about the labs ready. I apologize. If you cobbled together some coherent questions, great! If not - if you thought the form was confusing - don't worry about handing it in.

# Grades
Thank you for your patience as a I finish up grading!
