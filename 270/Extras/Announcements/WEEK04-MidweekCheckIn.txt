^^ WEEK 04 - Midweek Check In

# Welcome to Chapter 4
Welcome to the weekend! Two things in this video, folks.

* A bit about the chroot jail lab (if you are having issues, make sure you are super careful with the files you are copying.

* A cool primer on how to use sudo and sudo -i when you need admin access.

Enjoy the weekend, take a small walk outside (even if it's cold). Even 10 minutes is refreshing!
