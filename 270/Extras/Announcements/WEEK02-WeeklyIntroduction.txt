^^ WEEK 02 - Weekly Introduction

^= = 

# Thanks
Thank you to everyone so far who has helped build the class community by participating in the Discussion and adding to FlipGrid. 

And thanks for an awesome experience so far!

# What to expect
This week we will start to experiment in Linux. The first lab in the chapter requires you to get access to Linux. Here are some pointers for the chapter:

* The best case scenario is to install a virtual machine (you'll need to understand VMs for other classes in this program, so now is a good time to try!). But if you can't do that, there are some other options. I like the Google Cloud Shell because it's browser based!

* I moved the Chapter 1 folder from *Upcoming Experiences* to *Current Experiences*.

* The Darknet Diaries lab asks you to listen to a podcast and then respond to it. One of the most popular pieces of feedback I get from students is how awesome Darknet Diaries is. Even if you don't like podcasts, you're probably gonna love this one. 

* When it comes time to summarizing articles in LinkedIn, please know that you need to read the instructions carefully. There is specific criteria for this assignment - you *need to be providing valuable information in your summaries*. Do *not* write things like, "Read this article to find out how to protect yourself!". That doesn't help the reader of your summary learn anything.

# Grading
I graded almost everything that was submitted last week, but I see a large number of things came in today. I'll work my way through them! Remember that work is due on Mondays at noon, but please don't wait until Monday to do them :)

# Meetings
Thank you to all that I've met with already, and I'm looking forward to meeting with the rest of you in the coming weeks! One thing to keep in mind - Starfish has double booked me for most of the meetings! So if you try to log on to the Google Meet and I don't let you in immediately, just come back in 4 or 5 minutes please. The meetings don't last super long.
