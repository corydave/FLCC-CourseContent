^^ WEEK 13 - Weekly Introduction

# InfoSec Report
This chapter ***is two weeks long!!!*** This is a culminating experience - everything you've done this semester leads up to this assignment. All the LinkedIn summaries. All the stuff we've looked at - passwords, cryptography, information, malware, firewalls, ransomware... *everything*. Your task is to write a report from a cybersecurity hack. It will have to be thorough and include a debriefing from *you*. You should help the reader of your work understand what could have been done better to prevent the issue. There are more specifications in the description and some sample work. 

All the submissions will be put into a book and made available to everyone!

# Labs from last week
A few people emailed me about the Bypass Front End Restrictions lab. I made a [video tutorial for the lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7C74QkEEbQ) and if you'd like to use it as a step-by-step guide, you can! I won't be taking off points for that lab.
