^^ 12 Ways to use AI to Help You!

In the exercise below, you'll go through twelve different steps - each step is a small exercise designed to help you learn how to harness the power of AI for good!

At the end, you'll receive a certificate. That's what you'll have to submit at the end of this module - so make sure you download it and save it. On the back of the certificate, you'll find summaries of each of these twelve tips!

Unfortunately, you won't be able to solve your progress, so make sure you have enough time (maybe 25 minutes) to go through all the steps.

Have fun!
