An *object* in JavaScript is a construct that can hold multiple pieces of information using a *key/value* pair. Check out this example:

```javascript

let data = {
     members:
     [
        {
          "name":"Dave Ghidiu",
          "age": 44
        },
        {
          "name":"John Ghidiu",
          "age": 44.001
        }
     ]
  }

console.log(data.members[0].name);
// Dave Ghidiu

```

In this chapter we'll be looking at some ways to use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files. It's important to know that JSON is:

* lightweight
* easy to read by humans (self-describing)
* integrates with many other languages
* supports strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, objects
