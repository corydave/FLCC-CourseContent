## How to Submit Assignment

Once complete, prepare your browser to appear like the example included here, capture the screen as an image file, Attach it here, and hit [Submit].

**How?** Make the project pane visible and scroll so the last section you have completed is visible (arrays). In addition, click the 3 dots in the upper right and choose "My Settings" to show your profile information (which should have your name showing)

Next, capture the screen as an image file. On Windows, use Windows Key + Shift + S. On macOS, use Command + Shift + 5. Save the image and attach it to this assignment.
