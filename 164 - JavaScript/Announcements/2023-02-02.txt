^^ WRAP-UP - 2023-02-02

# AGAIN, THANK YOU
Class was fun today! I learned some stuff. Glad I attended! Thank you for being gracious and also for finding 2 Bug Bounties!

I'm not enamored with the way the notes are being posted in Brightspace, so I'm working on changing them to be topical, not by date. So things might change a little. In the meantime, I have added to the notes from Tuesday and also renamed it *Input and Output*. You can [access the code in GitHub](https://github.com/corydave/FLCC_CSC_164/tree/main/01).



# HOMEWORK

You are on the hook for the Lab we discussed briefly in class - `Input and Output Pages`.

Some helpful code:

```

let numPeople = 6;
let numCandies = 56;

let candiesPerPerson = numCandies / numPeople;

console.log(candiesPerPerson); // 9.333333333333334
console.log(candiesPerPerson.toFixed(2));

```

...and:

```

let cost = 100;

// Output 3% of cost:
console.log(cost*0.03);

// Output cost plus 3%:
console.log(cost*1.03);

```



Also, if you did not[read up on JavaScript variables](https://javascript.info/variables), do it now. If you *did* read it, read it again.

Lastly, if you need help, email me at dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu!
