^^ LAB - `for` Loops

^= =

Create **HTML files** that include **JavaScript** to provide solutions for the following:

1. **Three Guesses** - Provide an input so the user can guess a number between 1 and 5. When they click a button, tell them if they got it right or wrong. Only give them three attempts!

    - Declare a variable named `guessCount` ***outside*** any functions (set it to `0`)
        - this is important so it won't be reset after each guess
###
    - You will **not** need a loop for this assignment! (the repeating happens because the visitor hits the button after each guess)

    - If the visitor guesses correctly, let them know on the page somewhere!

    - If the visitor has used their third and final guess, don't allow more attempts

    - it's okay if they keep guessing after they guess correct.

###
2. **Head Test** - Write a program that demonstrates the different heading tag sizes (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, and `h6`) by using a `for` loop that generates the tags automatically.

    - Use `.innerHTML` to add each heading to an element already on the page.
    - Remember that you will want to add on to the `innerHTML` not replace it, for each heading.
    - Use only **one `for` loop** statement with exactly **one `.innerHTML`** setting inside it!
    - Your page will look similar to this:

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h2>
<h4>Heading 4</h2>
<h5>Heading 5</h2>
<h6>Heading 6</h2>
```

<br />

3. **Roll the Dice** - Write a program that randomly finds results of two separate dice that will be rolled 7 times.
    - Use `innerHTML` to display the results of each pair of die rolls side by side in 7 paragraph elements.
    - **Use one `for` loop** to generate all of the die rolls AND the paragraphs
    - If a pair of die rolls have the same value, **Add a class** `"doubles"` to their paragraph element
    - Use CSS to style the `doubles` class so it stands out (bold, different color, or background, etc)
    - Your page could look like this:
        - roll 1: 5 and 2
        - roll 2: 3 and 6
        - **roll 3: 2 and 2**
        - roll 4: 1 and 4
        - **roll 5: 5 and 5**
        - roll 6: 6 and 1
        - roll 7: 5 and 3
###
    **Optional Challenge:** Also display a picture of "snake eyes" next to a paragraph that comes up with two ones!

## When complete, **zip the html files together**, **attach** the `.zip` file here, and **[submit]** here.

## Reminders

### `for` loops

`for` loops
Repeat what is in the body of the for loop 3 times by using variable `i` to count. Counting variable `i` starts at `1`, for loop continues while `i <= 3`, `1` is added to `i` each "iteration" through the loop:

```javascript
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    //using counting variable in output:
    element.innerHTML += 
        `<p id="item${i}">Thing ${i}</p>\n`; 
}
//writes this HTML code into the element:
```
```html
<p id="item1">Thing 1</p>
<p id="item2">Thing 2</p>
<p id="item3">Thing 3</p>
```

### Random Numbers
```javascript
let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;
```

### Updating Variables

```javascript
let a = 5; //a is assigned 5
a = a + 10; //a is now 15
a = a + 2; //a is now 2
a + 80; //a is still 2
a += 1; //a is now 3 (same as a = a + 1)
a = 5; //a is now 5 
```

### Add a Newline

`\n` in a string makes a new line!

```javascript
console.log("hi\nthere")
```

outputs:

<div>
    hi<br>there
</div>
