^^ LAB - CH01 - Design Quiz Questions

Your job is to write two quiz questions that can be administered to students in a JavaScript class. Actually, your question might be featured in a quiz in *this* class!

# Specifications

* This is not an exercise in coding; you are not to use HTML or JavaScript to write interactive questions. This is simply an exercise in you designing questions that will appear on a quiz.

* Your questions should reflect content from the current chapter.

* You should include four (4) choices. None of the choices can be "None of the above" or "All of the above". 

* You should indicate the correct answer. And provide justification for *why* it is the right answer.

* Your question should not be designed to trick students. That's mean! Frame your question as an authentic assessment of one thing we've learned so far.

* If your question contains code snippets for the quiz taker to consider, don't worry about formatting the code. I'll format it real good like.

# Inspiration

* Your question might provide code and ask the quiz taker to identify an error in the code.

* Perhaps you'd like to provide code and ask the student to predict what will happen.

* Maybe you'd like to provide the code and leave a line blank - ask the student to fill in the missing line of code.

* Pretty much any question is appropriate *as long as it queries students' knowledge*.

# Example

The following is a good example of what you should submit:

^=^ ,,,, 10

Consider the following code segment:

```javascript

let age = 44;

if (age > 44) {
  console.log("moldy oldy");
} else {
  console.log("youngin'!");
}
```

What will be output in the console?

<div style="margin-left:30px;">

A) 44

B) moldy oldy

C) youngin

D) nothing - this code will not compile

</div>
