^^ LAB - Decisions 3: Ranges and Logical Operators

^= =

Create **HTML files** that include **JavaScript** to provide solutions for the following:

1. **Retail Rating** - Ask the visitor to your page to rate a retail store from 1 to 10 and show them the word "Good", "Okay", or "Bad" in response.

    * You decide on the range of numbers that produce each output
    * Be sure that every number 1 to 10 results in an output
    * Show the rating on the page itself (not console or alert)


2. **Color Retail Rating** - Related to question 1: Ask a user for the name of a retail store, then ask the user for a rating of 1 to 10. This time, display the store name. Use the ranges from question 1 to decide how to color the background of the store name.

    * For example, if the number rating is in the good range, you could set the background color for the store name to cyan.
    * Format the store name with one of three different background colors based on the rating!
       * Hint: Write HTML tags as part of the string in the innerHTML and include an attribute with a different class or id depending on the range. `<p class="good">...`
       * Use CSS that selects the class or id and colors the background.
    * The store name on the page should use larger text than the input.


3. **Valid User** - Ask a user for their username. If it is the correct username, do nothing. If it is incorrect send an alert up that says "username incorrect!". 

    * Be sure that it works with a capital first letter or without a capital first letter.
    * You can decide what the valid username is, and if there should be more than one.

## When complete, **zip the html files together**, **attach** the .zip file here, and **[submit]** here.

||    //OR
!     //NOT
```

## Ranges
