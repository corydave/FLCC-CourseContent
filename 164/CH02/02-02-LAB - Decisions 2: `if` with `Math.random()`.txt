^^ LAB - Decisions 2: `if` with `Math.random()`

^= =

Create **HTML files** that include **JavaScript** to provide solutions for the following:

1. **Prediction** - Write a program that shows the user a random prediction about what will happen to them in the next five minutes.

    * There should be at least 3 possibilities
    * The page will only show one possibility when loaded.


2. **Loaded Dice** - Write a program that tells the visitor the result of rolling a six-sided die.

    * The output should be include "you rolled a " and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
    * There should be a much higher chance of rolling a 1 than the other sides (but all numbers should still be possible)


3. **Quizzer** - Write a quiz program that asks three multiple choice questions.

    * Each question is up to you to invent.
    * Each question should show all the choices at once in a single prompt.
    * Each answers should list a preceding number or letter to make it easier for the visitor to type in an answer.
    * Keep track of how many answers the visitor gets correct.
    * Display the number of correct answers once all three questions are answered.

## When complete, **zip the html files together**, **attach** the .zip file here, and **[submit]** here.

## Random reminders

Math.random() gives a number that could be thought of as a percentage like .35 or .95 and you can multiply that by a larger number to get almost up to the maximum. You need the +1 to get up to the high number (and not have 0 as a low)

Generating a random number using Math.random for whole numbers 1 to 10:

```javascript
//Math.floor is used to truncate (chop off) 
//everything after the decimal point
let score = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
```

You can just output a random number or use it in a calculation, but you can also use it to make a less predictable decision:

```javascript
//if random score is greater than 8, log a message 
if (score > 8) {
    console.log("that's a good score!")
}
```
