^^ LAB - Decisions 1: Using `if`

^= =

Create **HTML files** that include **JavaScript** to provide solutions for the following:
1. **Your Name is My Name** - Make a page that greets the visitor and prompts them to enter their name. Then:

    * If the user enters **your** name, update the page to compliment them on being such a great JavaScript programmer.

    * Be sure that the page only compliments them in that one situation!


2. **Secret** - Create a page that lets the visitor enter a four digit number code. Then:

    * If it matches a specific 4 digit code of your choice, reveal a secret message somewhere on the page. Use `document.querySelection().innerHTML`. 
        
    * The page should have a heading that says "This Page Has a Secret" and a paragraph that says, "Did you find it?" 

    * Only when the code is entered correctly will the secret message appear. 

    * *Note*: The 4-digit code number and secret message is up to you, *does it work with a 0 as the first of 4 digits, though?*.


## When complete, **zip the html files together**, **attach** the .zip file here, and **[submit]** here.

# Reminders for using if

Check agenda and class recordings for more.

## Basic structure

```javascript
if ( condition ) {
  //do stuff
}
else {
  // do this other stuff
}
```

## condition

Some examples of boolean (*true* or *false*) math that could be used as a condition for the if:

```javascript
if (10 >= 12) {} // false

if (myVariable < 2) {}
//true for values less than 2

let myVariable = 5;
let otherVariable = "5";
if (myVariable == otherVariable) {}
//true because both have same value

if (myVariable === otherVariable) {}
//false: they are not strictly equal

```
