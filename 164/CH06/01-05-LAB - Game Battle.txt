^^ LAB - Game Battle

In this next phase of the game, you will create a battle! There are a few things to keep in mind:

* You don't *need* to have a mechanism to choose the characters to battle. For example, if you have 3 characters you can elect to have the Battle function just fight the first two in the array. Or it might pick 2 characters at random. Or, if you're feeling punchy, let the user pick which two characters will compete!

* You don't need to do anything super glamorous. This is a wireframe proof of concept. You might want to use the console to dump information for debugging, but the winner should be announced in the window (or using an alert).

* Be sure to [watch the video]() from class for an example. You can also [check out the *^icon b-github* code from class](https://github.com/corydave/FLCC_CSC_164/blob/main/06%20-%20Objects/battle.html).

Here's a quick and dirty view of the progress we made during class.
