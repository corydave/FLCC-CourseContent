^^ Class on Thursday, February 9

Hey folks!

# Notes on class from Tuesday

* I rearranged the look of chapter 1 in Brightspace to streamline it a bit more. It should make *more* sense than before.

* I posted the video from class on Tuesday as well as a review of what we covered (including the code).

* I modified the code *slightly*. Much like you should include `rel="stylesheet"` when listing an external CSS file, you *should* include the type of file for an external JavaScript file using the attribute `type="text/javascript"`. So the code to reference the `basic.js` file should look like this:

<center>

`<script type="text/javascript" src="basic.js"></script>`

</center>

# Class on Thursday

We will be having a work day! It's going to be a day to catch up, work on the lab that was posted, and help each other explore JavaScript.

## Let's be careful out there
