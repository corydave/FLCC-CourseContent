^^ LAB - Lists

As you know, an *array* is one variable that can hold multiple values. We can access any one of the values but using the *index* of each element.

```javascript

// Declare an array with three values
let names = ["Maria", "Ayana", "Dava"];

// Output the value with index 1
window.alert(names[1]); // Ayana

```

In this lab, we will look at adding some interaction with a list. The HTML and CSS files will be provided. Your job is to add JavaScript to make several functions operable. Note that the array, `names`, has been created for you.

* `addName()` will grab the value in the text box and add it to the array.

* `showNames()` will display the names, in the order that they were added to the array. They should be displayed in the `div` with the id of `output`.

* `reverseNames()` should reverse the order of the elements in the list `names`.

* `sortNames()` should sort the order of the elements in the list `names`.

* `random()` should randomly select one of the elements from the array and display it using `window.alert()`.

* `clearNames()` should clear the values in the array as well as the values in the `div` with the id of `output`. This function has been done for you!
