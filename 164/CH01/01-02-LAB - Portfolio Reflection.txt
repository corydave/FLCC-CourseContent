^^ LAB - Portfolio Reflection

For this lab, you need to submit a few things:

1. A link to your portfolio from CSC-162
2. An honest and critical reflection of your portfolio. Consider:
    * Your reflection should be honest, candid, and reflective. Meager reflections that exhibit lack of emotion, critical thought, inattention to detail, and grammatical/spelling mistakes will not be accepted. This is *your* first opportunity to demonstrate your passion for this field.

    * You should include a list of things you learned during 162. You don't have to itemize everything you learned, but you *should* make an effort to identify your biggest takeaways.

    * I'd also like to know where you struggled in the process. I am curious about what the hardest parts of 162 was. What was difficult for you to grasp. Do you know why?
    
    * By the next class you will need to have access to the server space allocated for you by the school. Please make sure you take appropriate action to find out your login credentials.
