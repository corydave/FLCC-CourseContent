# Recap
In class Tuesday we took a *brief* look at JavaScript - we wrote a function that was hooked to a button. When the button was clicked, that function would execute, grab an element by its ***id***, and change the `display` property to `none`, effectively hiding it.

Today we are going to gain a conceptual appreciation of JavaScript with an autodidactic (that means self-learning!) tool called Grasshopper.

Google has developed a really slick platform for learning conceptual JavaScript - it's called Grasshopper. There are a few different classes you can take. We will be looking at *Fundamentals* (not *Fundamentals II*).

Sign in at https://grasshopper.app and go through all the tutorials up to (and including) **Arrays** (the last exercise in **Arrays** is "`Checkerboard`".

There is an assignment in this chapter called `Grasshopper #1` - you should look at the specifications in that assignment as you'll have to submit a screenshot of your progress as evidence of completion.

You'll be doing `Grasshopper #1` in class Thursday. Don't feel bad about asking others for help - that's COMPLETELY OK. In fact, you should. You are a small cohort. You need to get used to helping each other out.

There is another assignment that needs to be done by Tuesday as well - that's the `Portfolio Assignment`. You should read the details there, too, to make sure you know what to submit.

Enjoy the day with Professor McLaughlin!
