^^ LAB - CH01 - Quiz Questions

Your job is to write a quiz question that can be administered to students in a JavaScript class. Actually, your question might be featured in a quiz in *this* class.

# Specifications

* You should include HTML code and JavaScript. The code does not need to be robust (for instance, the HTML might just be a very simple page with an `<h1>` tag and perhaps a textbox or a `<p>` tag. Nothing major. The code we've looked at so far in class is representative of the simple structure we're looking for.

* You should include four (4) choices. None of the choices can be "None of the above" or "All of the above". 

* You should indicate the correct answer.

* Your question should not be designed to trick students. That's mean! Frame your question as an authentic assessment of one thing we've learned so far.

* If you can submit the code formatted, sick. If not, don't worry. I'll format it real good like.

# Inspiration

* Your question might provide code and ask the quiz taker to identify an error in the code.

* Perhaps you'd like to provide code and ask the student to predict what will happen.

* Maybe you'd like to provide the code and leave a line blank - ask the student to fill in the missing line of code.

* Pretty much any question is appropriate *as long as it queries students' knowledge*.
