^^ LAB - Separate Files && Math

JavaScript files have a .js extension (HTML has .html, CSS has .css).

Let's do a basic setup and help make the connections.

# Setup

# Steps

In the **Basic JavaScript** Course, there are many small exercises, including instruction. Start by clicking **Comment Your JavaScript Code**, the first exercise.

1. Read the instructions at the top.
2. In the right-hand side, type in the code requested (you may have to think about it!)
3. Click the "Run the Tests" button
4. If you get a big checkmark, click "Submit and go to next challenge" and continue to the next section, if not, go to the next step.
5. Read the feedback under the buttons on the left hand side. It should help you narrow down issues, so you can fix your code, so go to step 2!

# How to Submit

For this assignment, **complete up to and including "Find the Length of a String"**.

1. **Take a screenshot** of the page that includes that section complete.
2. Click the Menu button (top right) and choose Settings, scroll down to find the "**Download your data**" button and click it.
3. **Attach the downloaded file** to this assignment.
4. **Attach the screenshot** to this assignment.
5. Hit the submit button on this assignment.

The new assignment will help build up the way in which smaller aspects of JavaScript work, and should help if the Input Output assignments feel too steep a challenge.
