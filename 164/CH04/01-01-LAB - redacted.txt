^^ LAB - `redacted`

In this lab, you will be provided an HTML file, a CSS file, and an image. You will be submitting two files:
 - `redacted.html`
 - `redacted.js`

You will have to look at the code in the version of `redacted.html` that is provided to you and understand the structure. You will have to tweak this file and add some code to invoke a function in the JavaScript file that you will be creating called `redacted.js`.

The task is simple: when the user *uses the mouse to hover over the dark rectangle* the rectangle will disappear.

When you are done, you will submit a `.zip` file that contains `redacted.html` and `redacted.js`.

Note that there are several ways to solve this problem.
