Let's look at some of the cool beginnings of computing sciences! We'll check out some of the awesome pioneers in the annals of compute science. Then we'll each pick a cool topic to make a sick infographic on, and lastly we'll look at different number systems. 

Don't panic! We don't do much math in this class (though this chapter has a bit of math in it).
