^^ LAB - Personality Test

# Description

Some jobs might ask you to take a personality test; one of the more popular personality tests is the Myers-Briggs. Despite it's wide-scale adoption, the jury is still out on the efficacy.

Vox published the scathing article [Why the Myers-Briggs test is totally meaningless](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5881947/myers-briggs-personality-test-meaningless), Psychology Today countered with [In Defense of the Myers-Briggs](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/my-brothers-keeper/202002/in-defense-the-myers-briggs), and USA Today is on the fence ([Here's why people still take the Myers-Briggs test — even though it might not mean anything](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/06/myers-briggs-type-indicator-does-not-matter/3635592002/)).

At any rate, it's still good to know your results as it might come up in an interview some day. You can [take the personality test here](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp); it will take roughly 15 minutes.

When you are done, save the results as a PDF or a screenshot and submit them here.

Also, the Computing Sciences department is interested in your anonymous results (as we get lots of data, we can share the results with future students). Please consider filling out this form.
