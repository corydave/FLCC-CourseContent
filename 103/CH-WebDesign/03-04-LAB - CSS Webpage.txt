^^ LAB - CSS Webpage

# Description

Leveraging cascading style sheets (CSS), create a website that makes use of neat styling. You should have at least five classes in your style sheet. Consult notes from class for examples, or use some of these resources:

* [w3schools - CSS and HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/) - a good introduction to CSS and HTML

* [CSS Tricks website](https://css-tricks.com/) - for advance, super sweet CSS tips

* [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) - a cool online HTML/CSS editor

* [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) - another cool online HTML/CSS editor

Each class should have at least four attributes, though you can have more than four if you'd like.
You should have at least 12 different attributes in your CSS. This means that you can repeat some of them, but you need to have at least 12 unique attributes.

You will need to include a :hover style, too.
If multiple files are involved, please submit the assignment as one .zip file.
The ugliest website gets an award!
