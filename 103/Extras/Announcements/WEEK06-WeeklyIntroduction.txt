^^ WEEK 06 - Weekly Introduction

^= =

# What to expect this week
We'll be looking at *Networking* and *Cybersecurity* this week. Please note there is a video for Cybersecurity that I haven't posted yet. It will be up by Wednesday!

There are a few videos that **you should totally watch**. The best one is Hacking WiFi at Starbucks. But all the videos are super fascinating in my opinion.

# A few observations
The **ping** command wasn't working on all Google Cloud Shell. If you *do* want to use it in the future, you can install it by typing:

```java
sudo apt install iputils-ping 
```

Also, *please* check the comments for all the work you submit. In many cases I encourage you to resubmit! One of the biggest issues was that the Google Docs (or Slides) were not shared appropriately. That's an easy fix!
