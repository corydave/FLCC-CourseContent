^^ WEEK 02 - Weekly Introduction

^= = 

# Thanks
Thank you to everyone so far who has helped build the class community by participating in the Discussion and adding to FlipGrid. 

And thanks for an awesome experience so far!

# What to expect
This week we will be looking at an introduction to Computing Sciences. A few things to keep in mind:

* I moved the Chapter 1 folder from *Upcoming Experiences* to *Current Experiences*.

* The INFOGRAPHIC assignment has a rubric attached - you should look at the rubric *before* submitting your work. It will tell you exactly what you need to include üòÅ.

* The assignment where you are converting to and from different bases is certainly the most math we will do all semester, and it is probably one of the hardest assignments. Don't get bent out of shape if it seems like it's too much; it's not a great indicator of what to expect in this class.

# Grading
I graded almost everything that was submitted last week, but I see a large number of things came in today. I'll work my way through them! Remember that work is due on Mondays at noon, but please don't wait until Monday to do them :)

# Meetings
Thank you to all that I've met with already, and I'm looking forward to meeting with the rest of you in the coming weeks! One thing to keep in mind - Starfish has double booked me for most of the meetings! So if you try to log on to the Google Meet and I don't let you in immediately, just come back in 4 or 5 minutes please. The meetings don't last super long.
