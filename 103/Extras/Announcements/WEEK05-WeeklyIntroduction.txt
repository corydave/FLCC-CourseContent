^^ WEEK 05 - Weekly Introduction

# Continue your work
I wanted to remind you that you don't have any work due this Wednesday. Remember that this current chapter is two weeks long!

# Messy Problem
THIS IS A BIG ASSIGNMENT. It should command a lot of attention from you. This assignment requires you to really process a lot. Flimsy, one-dimensional solutions will not suffice. Please invest the requisite amount of time and thought and energy into this assignment. 

And don't forget that you also need to submit a flowchart with it.

# Grades
Hey folks - I know there are a number of assignments that haven't been entered into the grade book yet. One of the challenges of this high-touch course is that there are a lot of experiences. I assure you I'll have them done as soon as I can. I thank you for your patience!

Please note that work handed in late (but within the grace period) won't be graded as fast as work that was handed in on time.

# Need anything?
If you need *anything*, let me know. I'm here for you!
