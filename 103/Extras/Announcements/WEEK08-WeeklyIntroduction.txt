# Second week Careers && Planning

I hope you've had some fun with this chapter - I find it's always energizing to look at job postings.

Don't forget that your REFLECTION 9(the last assignment) is the second assessment piece for the semester. Please, please, *please* make sure you really spend time investing thought into your reflection. This has profound implications for your future!

Also, the Long Term Planning Sheet might need some reworking if you are part time or starting this semester. Please let me know if you have questions!

Thanks for your patience!

# Grades
I know that after the last batch of grades, some people handed in late work or resubmitted other assignments. I haven't finished regrading, but I will ðŸ˜€
