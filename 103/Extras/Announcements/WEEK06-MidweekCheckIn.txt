^^ WEEK 06 - Midweek Check In

# Here's what is happening

I had a few emails asking about the Router Simulation - that grade doesn't automatically go into your grade book, so if you did it and don't see a grade, that's OK! When I grade the rest of the content I'll add that grade in, too! 

Just make sure you put your name in one of the fields like the instructions say :)

Everything else this week is fairly straightforward (at least I didn't get any questions asked). But if you need anything, lemme know!!!!
