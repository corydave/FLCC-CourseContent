^^ WEEK 08 - Midweek Check In

# Spring Break!
Spring Break is happening!!!!!

This means a few things for you:

1. RELAX. Be sure to carve some time out for yourself.

2. Any work that is supposed to be do next week (the week of March 21) doesn't need to be handed in until *the next week*.

3. I'm shooting to have everything graded by the end of the week!

Enjoy yourself!
