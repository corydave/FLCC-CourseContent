^^ WEEK 04 - Midweek Check In

^= =

# How's it going?
Just a reminder to get outside and do something - even a short, 10 minute walk. Clear your head. Take a break. Enjoy being.

The Discussion was due on Friday (no grace period for Discussions). 

This is a two week chapter, so pay attention to the due dates :)

Enjoy the weekend!!!!
