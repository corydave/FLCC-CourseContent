^^ WEEK 11 - Weekly Introduction

# Laker Day
I hope you had a good Laker Day and took advantage of some of the offerings at the college (including TACOS!). Laker Day is always a good opportunity to recharge - please make sure that if you missed it this week you plan to attend next week).

# GAME DESIGN!!!
You did it! You've made it to the GAME DESIGN chapter! It's possible you aren't looking forward to this chapter - and that's OK - but even if you don't like games you are likely to find some outlet for creativity in here! This is a cool chapter and a departure from some of the other stuff we've been doing. 

One thing to note is that you can use HTML in your TWINE game if you'd like!
