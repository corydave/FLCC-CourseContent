^^ WEEK 03 - Midweek Check In

^= =

Hiya folks!

About halfway through the week. Here are the things you need to know for the week:

1. The workload is a bit lighter than last chapter (hopefully that will help with your planning).

2. Everything that has been submitted will be graded in the next three days. The infographics have been AMAZING so far!

3. Keep up the awesome work! I'm super impressed with the quality of work this semester!!!!
