^^ LAB - Set up Website for Portfolio

# Description

For the final project in this class, you will be required to create a portfolio that showcases a number of your pieces from the semester. The portfolio is meant to show growth and reflection across the semester!

This assignment gets things set up for the final project. Since we are in the Web Design unit, we'll be setting up the website!

# Requirements

All you need to do is set up the website. I recommend [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/new), but you may prefer other website creators such as [Wix](https://www.wix.com/),[Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/), [SquareSpace](https://www.squarespace.com/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), or anything other tool you'd like. You do not need to populate your portfolio with much information yet; this is just to set up the framework. There are three things you need to have:

1. A cool landing page

2. An "About Me" page

3. Eight subpages, each one set up to contain one piece of work you'd like to show off


You can see an example here - https://sites.google.com/view/daveghidiu/home.

Note&nbsp;that any work you do now can be modified for your final portfolio at the end of the semester.

<hr />


Here's the breakdown for each piece:

## Landing Page
Your landing page should say some general things - who you are, what your major is, something fun about yourself. But feel free to add more!

## About Me
Your "About Me" page talks about what your major is, your experience, and some other fun details. This focuses more on who you are. What are your ambitions? What do you enjoy doing? This doesn't have to be related to your academics or your career. Maybe you like fishing - add that! Include pictures! Eventually this page will also include your resume.

## Portfolio
Your portfolio setup (required for this assignment, but can be modified for the final portfolio.) For this assignment you need to set up the 8 pages, and include your Infographic as one of those pages. (You don't need to put content in any of the other 7 pages until the final portfolio is due at the end of the semester).

# Specifications

* A landing page.

* An "About Me" page.

* Eight different *subpages*, each one ready to accept a piece of work.

* One of your subpages should include your INFOGRAPHIC assignment. You should also write a small reflection on this page. The reflection should address:

    * A brief synopsis of the assignment

    * What you learned from the assignment

    * What you would do differently in the future

* Make sure you **publish** your website and submit a link.

* Please paste the link to your website in the submission.

* Please make sure you test your website "incognito mode" to make sure others can view it.

**NOTE:** Be sure to check out the rubric for this assignment to make sure you address all relevant parts.
