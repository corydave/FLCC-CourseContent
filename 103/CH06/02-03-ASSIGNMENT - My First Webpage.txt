^^ ASSIGNMENT - My First Webpage

# Description

For your first website, write code for a simple website. It needs to have the following items:

```html
<head></head>
<title></title>
<body></body>
<br />
<hr />
<b></b>
<u></u>
<i></i>
<a></a>
<font></font>
<iframe></iframe>
<center></center>
<img />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

```

Your file should have proper formatting (indenting for instance) - see the examples in this chapter for reference. Formatting includes tabs for code sandwiched between opened and closed tags. 

If your website has more than one file (such as an image), then please submit all the files.

# Specifications

* Please submit a .zip file, not an .html file.

* If you have multiple files (such as images or other HTML files, please include them in the .zip file).
