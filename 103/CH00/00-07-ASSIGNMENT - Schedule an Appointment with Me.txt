I want to get to know you! We will be using Google Meet to chat, and you'll use Starfish to schedule the meeting. That may sound overwhelming, but here's what you need to know:

<div style="margin-left:220px;">

* Google Meet is a free app for mobile devices, but if you're on a computer you don't even need an app; When you create an appointment, Starfish will email you. There will be a link in the email - just click on that link and it will bring you right into my video chat!

* ***Don't panic!!!*** These meetings aren't painful. I just wanna get to know you!!!

* Starfish is a tool that is built into Blackboard. It is meant to help make sure you can connect with everyone in the college that you need to. One of the features is the ability to schedule meetings! [You can find it here](https://flcc.starfishsolutions.com/starfish-ops/session/redirect.html).

<br />

Even if we've worked together in the past and we've had meetings, please schedule a meeting anyhow - I want to see your beautiful, smiling face!

If none of my posted times work, please email me and we can find a common time.

# Specifications

* There is nothing to submit for this assignment, once we meet I'll give you credit. Please make sure you show up to the meeting though (otherwise you'll get a zero for the assignment and nobody wants that!).

* Please pick a date *before* November 30.
