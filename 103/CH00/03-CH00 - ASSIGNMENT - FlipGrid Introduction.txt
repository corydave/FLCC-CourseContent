We will be using Flipgrid for this exercise. It's a great way for all of us to get to know each other and does not require you to download an app or create an account.

To post an entry, you just need to login with your student ID and hit record! If you need help, you can [check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTBLq-WUC88).

If you can't see the FlipGrid, go directly to the website (https://flipgrid.com/55d21f99) or download the app. Our "Flip Code" is **55d21f99**.

The assignment is to post a short video where you tell us how to pronounce your name, something awesome about yourself, and where you live.

Note that the "Student username" in this exercise is actually your student number. If you have any issues with this, email me at dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu and I'll help you out!
