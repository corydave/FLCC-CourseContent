^^ ASSIGNMENT - Library Research Tutorial

# Description

<div style="display:block;width:100%;">

The Library is housed at the Canandaigua campus. It has three floors, though you can only access the library on the second floor. The staff and faculty in the library are super helpful and will help you with any question you have and will assist you with any research project. They also have a lot of supports and resources for fully online students who don't visit campus at all.

The Library website has a tutorial for students who are getting started with research. You can expect to do some research while you are at FLCC, and the Library is there to help you. Take the online tutorial - if you pass the quiz at the end, you'll get a certificate. Submit that here.

Note that you can take other tutorials online, too, and get cleared to use some of the sweet toys at the library (like the 3D Printer). Note that you must include a PDF or screenshot of your CERTIFICATE, not the email that will be sent to you. It looks like this:

There are a few different ways to take a screenshot on a computer, and it varies across operating systems:

* On a PC, press WINDOWS KEY + SHIFT + S

* On a Mac, press SHIFT + COMMAND + 3

* On a Chromebook, press SHIFT + CONTROL + SHOW WINDOWS

**NOTE:** You're going to have to submit this file twice! I will give you a zero the first time you submit. Not because you did a lousy job. Not because I'm a jerk. Not because I don't have faith in your work. But because there is a valuable skill here - *how to resubmit in Blackboard*. 

There is this wonky behavior in Blackboard where if you are in the grade book and you click on an assignment, you can't see the "Start Submission" button. Instead, you have to go through all the folders and find where you submitted the assignment the first time. *Then* you'll see that button. Here's a [quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w-u3XV1ge0).

After you submit it, I'll grade it. Once you see the zero in the grade book, please resubmit again and I'll grade it properly.

There are a few that might help as you prepare to do some light research at FLCC:

^= =

* **[Ask a Librarian](https://library.flcc.edu/ask.cfm)** - Call, email, or chat with a librarian. They can answer any questions you have and will even work with you to help you research.

* **[Research Tutorial](https://libguides.flcc.edu/c.php?g=536230)** - You can experience the entire tutorial, but for the assignment we are doing in class, Modules 3, 4, and 7 are the most relevant. They cover how to search and how to cite your work. You don't have to go through the tutorial, but it's helpful if you don't really know where to start.

* **[WFH Related Tools](https://libguides.flcc.edu/specialcircumstances)** - When COVID hit in March 2020, the Library put together some really neat resources. You might want to poke around in there (especially the pieces on tips for working from home and de-stressing.

* **[Computer Science Research Guide](https://libguides.flcc.edu/computer_science)** - This guide was custom made for the research assignment in this class! Dig around in here for more specifics on tackling the assignment.
