Hopefully the syllabus and orientation video in this chapter has helped you make sense of how the class work. So here's your first quiz!

You need to score an 80% or better on the quiz to see the rest of the content in the chapter.

Don't worry! You can take the quiz as many times as you'd like (but keep in mind that if you take a quiz after the due date, it will not be automatically graded and you'll have to email me and let me know - so it's in your best interest to take the quizzes before the due date.
