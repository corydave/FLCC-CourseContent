Throughout this course, there will be assignments that require you to make a copy of a Google Doc, do some work in it, and then submit the link to me. It's mission critical that you set the sharing permissions such that **Anyone with the link can comment**. Otherwise, I might not have access to the documentðŸ˜¥.
This is your first opportunity to do that!

This is also your first opportunity to submit a document more than once (it's practice for those times when you might have to resubmit some work).
