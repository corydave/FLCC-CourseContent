^^ ASSIGNMENT - Complete a Long Term Planning sheet

# Explanation

^= =

The *Long-Term Planning Sheet* is a document where you'll lay out all the courses you have taken, you are taking, and what you have to take in the next few semesters. Nothing you do in this sheet is set in stone - you can always take whatever classes you want. But the intention here is to get you thinking clearly about what's left in your academic pursuit here at FLCC!

## Steps

There are a few steps you'll need to do to fill out this LTP:

1. Check out the **Program Evaluation** in [Webadvisor](https://webadvisor.flcc.edu/)

2. Look at the [**Course Descriptions**](https://flcc.edu/courses/)

3. Also in [Webadvisor](https://webadvisor.flcc.edu/), check out the **Course Schedule**

4. Fill out the [Long-Term Planning Sheet](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdl5dodF_swxwlysDUIfikAS56vt62dY0LqUxccoLo-JzdChQ/viewform)

## Tips

^= = = ,

Note that it's possible that the LTP doesn't reflect some classes you might need to take (mostly math prerequisites). You can add them at the bottom using the checkboxes!

^=== ,

There are some extra semester hidden, too, in case you need more than four - you can expand them from the left side.

^=== ,

Make sure you take a tour through the rest of the tabs in the document, too, so you can understand the SUNY General Education classes, see some course descriptions, etc.
