^^ LAB - Reflect on SPENT

# Description

After going through the SPENT simulation ([access it here](http://playspent.org/)), record your reaction and submit it here. You don't need to write much, but I do want to hear your impression of the simulation. You don't have to answer any of the questions below - they are just suggestions. Your guiding principle for this assignment is to help me understand what you thought of the experience.

* Was it a useful use of your time?

* Did you have a visceral reaction?

* Does SPENT hit you on an emotional level?

* Did you enjoy the experience?

# Specifications

* There is no specification for the length of this assignment.

* Include a screenshot of the end of the game (even if you did not make it the full 30 days).

* Submit a link to a cloud-based document such as Google Docs.

* Verify that the document is shared such that ["Anyone with the link can COMMENT"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGXfLDctcI)
