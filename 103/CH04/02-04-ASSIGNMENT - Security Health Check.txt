Honestly, unless you keep up on the issues of cybersecurity every day (the sector moves at breakneck speed), it's easy to miss some of the things you can do to bolster your security and privacy.

This is not an assessment! You'll receive a perfect grade just for doing this security check! This is more of a check-in to see if you are as safe and protected as you could be.

Answer each question as best as you can.

**DO NOT ENTER ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION (such as passwords, PINs, etc.).**
