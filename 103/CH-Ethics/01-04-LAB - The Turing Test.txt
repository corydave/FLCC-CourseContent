^^ The Turing Test

# Description

In this activity, we will explore human-generated and AI-generated content. Then we will consider and discuss how we feel about AI-generated work and the potential impacts of AI on our society. 

1. [Take this version of Turing Test](https://daveghidiu.com/103/turingTest.html) - it is also embedded below.

2. When you finish, you will be presented with a final result. Please take a screenshot that shows your name and how you did.

3. In a cloud-based document (such as Google Docs), paste your result.

4. Answer the following questions in your document as well:

    1. Do you think AI-generated work is original? Why or why not?<br /><br />

    2. Is it important for the evolution of a society to have members that continue to produce original work? Why or why not?<br /><br />

    3. When looking at a piece of work to evaluate its quality, merit, and/or value, is it important that we know if that piece of work is generated by a human or by AI? Why or why not?
