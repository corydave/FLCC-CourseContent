## AI Show and Tell

1. Choose **one** of the five listed AI **use cases**. 
    - Note: If there are already 3 people that posted a thread about images, please choose a chat bot use case
2. Use the links below to visit an AI system website to create a free or trial account and log in.
3. Try a starter prompt suggested by your chosen use case
    - You don't have to use the examples. It's more fun to try your own.
    - You will want a record of your prompts and the results (copy and paste, as needed)
4. Try improving the prompt to get better results.
5. **Go to the discussion, and create a post** to paste your experience into (the prompts and the results) so everyone can see it and discuss it.
6. **Reply to two other posts from an ethical standpoint**: What are the potential benefits? What are the potential drawbacks? What should we be concerned about? What are the ethical considerations?
