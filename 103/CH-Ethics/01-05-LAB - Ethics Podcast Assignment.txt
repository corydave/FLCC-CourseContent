^^^ The Indicator - Did AI Write This Headline?

If you choose this podcast, you'll need to listen to both of the episodes (they are about 9 minutes each).

**Did AI Write this Headline?**

*The new chatbot, ChatGPT, has been hailed by some as the end of homework. Like why even learn to write when a chatbot can do it for you? But the stakes are higher than just homework. What if this kind of AI generates propaganda or calls to violence? Will anyone be able to tell the difference between something written by AI or a human? Does it matter?*

* Fun and quick and informative
* 9 minutes

**Artists vs. AI**

*Artificial intelligence has advanced enough to create a seemingly original artwork in the style of living artists within minutes. Some artists argue that these AI models breach copyright law.*

* Also fun and quick and informative
* 9 minutes

^^^ Flash Forward: Choose Your Own Adventure

*The gist is simple: Welcome to Vanguard Estates is a choose your own path story. Each episode has a number, and a short title, and at the end of every episode you’ll be presented with a choice. All you have to do is follow the numbers, or titles, whichever works best for your brain, and you’ll be on your way.*

This is a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-Type experience. You start at episode one, and at the end you are given a decision to make; the choice you make will bring you to another mini-episode. 

* This is a *really* good, thought-provoking experience.
* Roughly 30 minutes to explore one path

^^^ Managing the Future of Work - AI: The Good, The Bad, and the Transformative

More and more businesses are turning to AI for its efficiencies and revolutionary potential, but its proliferation has sparked widespread skepticism and questions about equity, privacy, liability, transparency, and security. AI expert and entrepreneur Manoj Saxena parses the business, policy, ethics, and workforce implications.*

^^^ Freakonomics - How to Stop Worrying and Love the Robot Apocalypse
