In the [Ethics Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U_dAft581JVb_Q-1TWwenArcoR5VP14dsz1K7IMX-w4/edit), there are a few scenarios to consider. Pick at least three of the scenarios that interest you, and engage in dialogue in this Discussion Forum. You must have meaningful conversation to warrant a grade. Since ethics are tied to experience and personal beliefs, there are no wrong answers. Be civil in the conversation. Engage. Give us your thoughts. You don't have to believe in your position, but you *do* need to provide a rational argument for your position.

Substantive posts and replies will be graded; disposable, empty posts and replies will not.
