^^ ASSIGNMENT - Hardware Lesson

This experience is designed to provide on-the-fly learning. You might have a lot of knowledge about computers and hardware so you might already know many of the answers. Or it's possible you are new to the world of super-tech-nerdy computer hardware (welcome aboard!) - don't panic! You can use whatever resources you want to help you gain understanding.Â 

Oh - and you can go through this as many times as you'd like ðŸ˜€
