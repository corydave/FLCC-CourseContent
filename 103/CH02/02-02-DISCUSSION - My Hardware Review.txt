Time to share what you are working with!Â 

The intent of this discussion is to share your computer hardware. Maybe you have a laptop. Maybe you have a sick gaming computer. Maybe you have a mining rig. Me, I mostly use a Chromebook. But whatever you use, share it with us! Be sure to include specs:

Processor/CPU
RAM
Hard drive type (HDD or SDD) and storage

If you want to nerd out, share your monitor refresh rates. Or your PSU specs. Or other ultra-nerdy computer specs!
