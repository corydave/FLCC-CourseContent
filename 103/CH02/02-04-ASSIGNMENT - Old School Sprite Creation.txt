^^ ASSIGNMENT - Old School Sprite Creation

^= =

# Description

Time to make an old school graphic! In the example here, you can see a ghost that looks a bit like the ghosts from Pac Man. You will [make a copy of this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBScLzdzUcoe-2ts7wfROXlAbjjOdOxsE7h7RX7A5VA/copy), design a sprite, and then add the numbers on the blank lines to the left of the image.

Use the technique demonstrated in the ["How oldschool graphics worked" video](https://youtu.be/Tfh0ytz8S0k?t=306) to calculate the data needed to generate a hardware sprite on a Commodore 64. 

Note that in the video, the image had 3 bytes of data per line; we'll only be using one byte of data.

To make your own sprite in the Google Sheet, simply put an "X" in a cell. That cell will turn gray. To revert the cell back to white, click into the cell and hit delete or backspace.


# Specifications

* The lines in column L should each contain a number between 0 and 255 - that number correlates to the value of the colored bits in each line.

* Please do not add any columns.

* This must be submitted as a cloud-based document and be shared such that ["Anyone with the link can COMMENT"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGXfLDctcI).
