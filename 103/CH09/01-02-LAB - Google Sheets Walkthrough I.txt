^^ LAB - Google Sheets Walkthrough I

# Description

^= =

Let's look at how Google Sheets can really be leveraged. Sheets is *such a potent tool* and you should really know a few of the cool things you can do with it.

I've made a video that walks through some of the really nifty things you can do with Sheets. Your job is to follow along and do all the cool things, too!

I've made you a Sheet with the same data, but the entire sheet is unformatted. You'll have to follow along and when you're done, your document should look very similar to mine.

To get a copy of the Google Sheet, make sure you are logged into your account and [**click here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ktXvHIfHSIuKE34AxBafmoBdTEkhBl-vOayhr3pyoiE/copy).

Share the link so that "Anybody with the link can ***edit***".

# Specifications

* Submit the PDF version of your Google Sheet.

* Submit a link to the Google Sheet, too.

* Verify that the document is shared such that ["Anyone with the link can ***EDIT***"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGXfLDctcI).
