^^ ASSIGNMENT - Google Docs Walkthrough II

# Description

^= =

Let's look at how Google Docs can really be used as an instrument to rock your research paper skills!

I've made a video that walks through some of the really nifty things you can do with Docs. Your job is to follow along and do all the cool things, too! Make sure you have completed the Spreadsheets [Part II] assignment first - you'll need to pull information from that document.

I've made you a Doc with some sample writing, but the entire document is unformatted. You'll have to follow along and when you're done, your document should look very similar to mine.

To get a copy of the Google Doc, make sure you are logged into your account and [click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KDK3zWYONJ3SdmNiIpk7gONRSKkhxzbftvPTYdt4q1w/copy).

Share the link so that "Anybody with the link can **edit**" in the "Write submission" portion of this assignment in Blackboard.
