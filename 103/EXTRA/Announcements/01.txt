^^ ANNOUNCEMENT - 2020-01-17

# Welcome!!!

Hiya! I'm so glad you are embarking on the CSC-103-Portal journey!

This course is 99.9% created, but it isn't *quite* ready to be rolled out yet. Today is Monday, January 17. It will be ready on January 18 at 9:00 AM. You should stay tuned because this will be The. Best. Course. Ever.

Or, at least I'll try to make it the best course you've ever taken. We will be going over a whole bunch of different things in this course:

* Game Design
* Website Design
* Networking & Cybersecurity
* Hardware & Operating Systems
* The history of computer science

We're going to have a ball! Please make sure you stop by on Tuesday after 9:00 AM to see the syllabus and *every chapter*.

Yes, that's right. The entire course will be available for you on Tuesday. You can soak up every bit of digital goodness starting at 9:00 AM. 

Be there or be square.
