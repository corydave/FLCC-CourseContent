^^ ASSIGNMENT - Messy Problems

These problems are multi-step, messy problems (a messy problem is one that is abstract, requires a lot of steps and some conversions, and probably has more than one "right" answer).

You will be assigned ONE of these problems. Research it as much as you can and then present an answer. There are a few problems that may require you to be on campus (most of them can be researched from anywhere - even problems that seem like you need to be on campus). If you find you are stymied by the remoteness of your problem, email me üòÅ.

Please read the entire assignment carefully - there are examples of a good submission and a not-so-good submission at the end of the assignment. Those examples should help inform your solution.

This assignment is graded on your solution (your pathway, your journey), not the final answer. As such, one of the vital ingredients in this process is developing an algorithm - a procedure - that helps you solve the problem. ***So make sure to include a flowchart!***

If you have any questions along the way, please email me!

# Specifications

* This is a complex assignment; it is an attestation to the knowledge you've acquired in this chapter. As such, the effort and awesomeness of this assignment should be of the highest standard.

* Similar to the *Computational Thinking Problems*, you should present a log, a journey, of the path that took you to your solution.

* Don't worry if your answer is right; just be concerned if your answer *seems* like it might be right. For instance, there is a question about the number of blades of grass at CMAC. I've had students submit radically different answers (like, off by billions from each other), yet their *processes* were sound and made sense. Each of those students with solid solutions received perfect scores.

* Include a flowchart.

* The final presentation should be something you are proud of.

* The final presentation should also be something that I can hand to a twelve year old kid and they can follow your logic and your solution.

* Any information you research should be cited. Hyperlinks are fine.

* This must be submitted as a cloud-based document and be shared such that *anyone with the link can comment*.
