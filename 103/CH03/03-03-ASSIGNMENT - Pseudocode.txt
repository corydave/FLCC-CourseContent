^^ ASSIGNMENT - Pseudocode

# Description

Choose a daily task (like making espresso or putting gas in a car) and write a pseudocode solution. The end result should be such that anyone should be able to look at the pseudocode and understand your instructions.Â 

Remember that pseudocode is similar to an outline of a paper - it's a draft of your thoughts. It should be logically complete (that is, the algorithm should be sound), and you should make use of indenting and each of the reserved words.

The reserved words are:

* **START**
* **READ (or INPUT)**
* **PRINT (or OUTPUT)**
* **IF**
* **ELSE**
* **WHILE**
* **END**

# Specifications

* You ***must*** use all the reserved words in this assignment.

* Please make sure your pseudocode is formatted appropriately - this includes indenting and **END** statements for loops and **IF** statements.

* Your work should be cloud-based. Make sure the work is available to "anyone with the link can comment"). 

* Please paste the link in the WRITE SUBMISSION portion of Blackboard, not the COMMENTS section.
