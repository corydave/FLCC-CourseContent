# Specifications

* This flowchart should have multiple subroutines (often called a "pre-defined process"). In this example, the pre-defined processes include "Make coffee", "Brush teeth", "Get changed", and "Drive to work". You do not need to also create the subroutines.

* The flowchart should be complete. That is, it should accurately and completely represent the tasks it is designed to describe. There should not be any flow issues (for instance, a nonsensical path or incomplete path).

* There *can* be multiple ending points (for instance, a decision in the flowchart might lead to two different outcomes as end states).

* Your work should be cloud-based. Make sure the work is available to "anyone with the link can comment"). 

* Please paste the link in the WRITE SUBMISSION portion of Blackboard, not the COMMENTS section.
