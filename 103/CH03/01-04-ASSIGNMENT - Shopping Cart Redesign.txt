^^ ASSIGNMENT - Shopping Cart Redesign

# Description

Together as a class we discussed common problems (and potential problems) related to shopping carts. You will ideate a new product that addresses the concerns that were addressed in the brainstorming session. That means that your submission must address several of the concerns discussed.

# Specifications

* A cloud-based document (presentation, document, etc.). Make sure that the document is shared so that anyone who has the link can view it (see image below).

* You must address at least ***three*** of the concerns discussed in the Discussion.

* The solution should be broad and address identified problem; they should avoid specific solutions <br /><br />*For example, it is sufficient to say that "...the metal material used in shopping carts should be replaced with a lighter weight, less expensive material" instead of researching actual lightweight, strong materials and suggesting that the cart be made of "an adamantium and vibraniumÂ alloy because of the tensile strength and rigidity under heat and sheer stress."*

* The new product should include visuals. This may mean the you may have to sketch/design a visual, or somehow construct a visual using software. <br /><br />*In the past, students have hand drawn some images, taken pictures of them with their phone, and inserted those images. Other students have used software on their phone or tablet to draw an image. Occasionally students will use CAD software and render a 3D image of their carts! The sky is the limit.*
