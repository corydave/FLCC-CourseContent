Whereas *flowcharts* visually depict a process, *pseudocode* is more nuanced; it is a generic framework for writing an algorithm. It is agnostic of programming languages and contains fundamental structures that most languages have.

For instance, Java (and most other languages) have the notion of loops, though there are a lot of differences in how loops are written from language to language. Consider the following two loops - the first from Java and the second in Python:

<div style="clear:both;">

```java
  while (counter < 10) {
    System.out.println("Hi");
    counter++;
}
```
```python
  while counter < 10:
    print("Hi")
    i = i + 1
```

</div>

Despite the syntax, these loops accomplish the same thing. The important thing is that both could be represented a bit more abstractly:

```java
  WHILE counter less than 10
    output the word "Hi"
    increase counter by one
  END WHILE
```
Note that in this example, Java has the code indented in the **while** loop (as it should be, but failure to indent does not affect performance). Python *requires* that the lines of code to be repeated are indented - that's how the compiler knows which lines of code are attached to the **while** loop).

In pseudocode, you should not only indent the lines that will be repeated in the loop but *also* be sure to indicate when the loop ends (as in the example above).

This quiz assesses your understanding the basic tenets of pseudocode.

Don't worry! You can take the quiz as many times as you'd like (but keep in mind that if you take a quiz after the due date, it will not be automatically graded and you'll have to email me and let me know - so it's in your best interest to take the quizzes before the due date.
