# RESOURCES

## TUTORIAL
* [Twinery Wiki](https://twinery.org/wiki/)
* [Harlowe Manual](https://twine2.neocities.org/)
* [Writing Interactive Fiction in Six Steps](https://www.dashjump.com/blog/writing-interactive-fiction-six-steps/)
* [YouTube video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlXuD3kyVEr5tlic4SRe6ZG-R9OyS1T4d)

## IMAGES AND VIDEOS
* You can include images using the HTML `<img>` tag:
```html
<img src="http://walkerbay.com/wp-content/gallery/8-performance-sail-kit/wb_2466_sail.jpg">
```
* You can include videos by putting in their embed code.

## VARIABLES
* To create a variable, use the "set" command to give the variable a value, and prepend the name of the variable with a "$":
    * `(set: $pancakes to 0)`
*To display a variable, use the “print” command
    * `(print: $pancakes)`
* You can update a variable based on its current value:
    * `(set: $pancakes to $pancakes + 1)`

## PROMPTS
* If you want to ask the user for a piece of information (and then use it later on), the easiest way to do that is using the “prompt” command.
* In the following example, this line of code will both prompt a user for their name and then also set the value to `$name`:
    * `(set: $name to (prompt: "Your name, please:", ""))`

## NAVIGATION
* To go from one passage to another, use:
    * `[[Go East -> Room4]]`
        * This will display the text "Go East" and will take the user to the passage "Room4" if it is clicked.
