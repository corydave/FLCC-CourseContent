^^ ACTIVITY - Play Zork && Oregon Trail

# Description

Game design has gotten extremely advanced and competitive in the past two decades. Even before the pandemic and quarantine, the gaming industry was bigger than Hollywood ($100 billion) and North American sports ($75 billion). 

*Combined*. Don't believe me? Check out [this MarketWatch article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/videogames-are-a-bigger-industry-than-sports-and-movies-combined-thanks-to-the-pandemic-11608654990).

Or just try to buy a new Xbox or PS5.

Let's look at some of the original games that also took the world by storm.


## Zork

One of the most iconic games in home computing is Zork. Iconic, that is, if you were playing games at home in the late seventies. Zork is a pioneer in *interactive fiction* and text-based games. It was so popular that Zork would spawn two sequels and launch a genre of game that is still around today.

Contemporary games are in a different class of games, though text-based adventures still have a place (consider the success of [Telltale Games](https://telltale.com/) - until recently, that is). There still is a demand for "interactive fiction" games (the dynamics of text-based adventure with some stylistic graphics).

To fully appreciate the experience of a strictly text-based game, you should try playing Zork (if you use the Safari browser, you might experience issues - use Chrome or Firefox instead)!

## Oregon Trail

If you went to school in the eighties or nineties, you played this game. It endures even today as nostalgic evidence of how immersive video games can be. Cool fact - The Oregon Trail computer game predates the tabletop sensation *Dungeon's & Dragons* by three years!

Check out the game here:
