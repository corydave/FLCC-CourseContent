# Description

[Twine](https://twinery.org/) is a game engine that allows people to make interactive fiction games with minimal amount of programming ([Quest](http://textadventures.co.uk/quest) is another platform that also allows for easy-to-make interactive fiction games). Ultimately, we'll be making a game with Twine (or Quest), so it's important to get a feel for what the games can do. Interactive fiction is a genre of games that allow the user to 

There are some very popular games in the IF realm:

* [You are Jeff Bezos](https://direkris.itch.io/you-are-jeff-bezos) (this game is fairly new, and is more of a thought experiment)

* [The Uncle Who Works for Nintendo](https://ztul.itch.io/the-uncle-who-works-for-nintendo)

* [With Those We Love Alive](http://slimedaughter.com/games/twine/wtwla/)

* [Queers In Love at the End of the World](https://w.itch.io/end-of-the-world)

* [The Temple of No](https://crowscrowscrows.itch.io/the-temple-of-no) (a good example of mixing stylistic graphics with IF)

* [Depression Quest](http://www.depressionquest.com/dqfinal.html)

In addition to these Twine games, you might be interested in these two games as well. They are interactive fiction but have a slightly different experience. Both of them take a modern twist on text-based games and make them "texting-based" games. The second game, [Somewhere](https://twinery.org/forum/discussion/6155/announcing-somewhere-a-twine-game-for-mobile), is made with Twine!
