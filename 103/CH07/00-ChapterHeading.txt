Let's take a peek at making video games! Regrettably, we won't be able to make a super-awesome, rich graphics game. But that's okay - we have a Game Design program at FLCC for that. This chapter is just a quick little dip into making games. We'll be making a text-based game (that relies on story and interaction) using Twine. You may have played games like these (think Zork or something like Telltale games).
