^^ READING - Places to find information on the job landscape

# Description

There are a lot of different places to find job postings for the technology sector. As the landscape is rapidly changing, more resources and tools are emerging.

The Networking & Cybersecurity field is on fire right now; there are millions of jobs, today, unfilled (the quote below is two years old). But that's not all - IT and software engineer jobs are plentiful too. And, according to Business Insider, at least 10 of the top 25 jobs that let you have a life outside of work are in these fields. The entire sector often places very high on lists of job satisfaction. In fact, according to [Human Resources Director Magazine](https://www.hcamag.com/us/news/general/10-jobs-with-the-highest-employee-satisfaction-ratings/257464), here is a list of jobs with some of the highest rankings in satisfaction. The article has more information (like where the jobs are predominantly located) that you should check out.

One thing I always look at is different job search sites. Even if I'm not looking for a job, I find these sites helpful in understanding the landscape of the market. For instance, if I feel like I'll be looking for a job in a year or so, I carve out time every few weeks to spin through some of the job search sites. That gives me an idea of how prevalent the jobs are, what the salaries are, and -- most importantly -- what qualifications or certifications I'll need to be considered.


Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, I would always look at jobs that let me work from home. To me, that's an important stipulation as it allows me flexibility. So here are some helpful sites for you to look at:
