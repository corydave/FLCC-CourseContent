It's time to look for a job! Using the search engines you've explored, find a job that you think you would be qualified for after getting this degree. 

You will have to get a copy of the [Job Report Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DqlF9750CCaLl6M9yOBWFNbPreEIJy4DKo5QTfFDha4/copy) and answer the questions. This experience is designed to help you interrogate what is really important in a job and consider the different variables that might affect your calculus. You'll also have to think about what actions you'll need to do to prepare for a job (schooling, certifications, internships, etc.).
