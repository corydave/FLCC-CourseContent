By now you should have looked at a wide variety of resumes - some of them lean more towards information and some are very stylistic. Creating resumes can be very daunting because you might not understand what potential employers are looking for. 

When creating a resume (which you'll be doing shortly!) you are likely to find thousands of websites that offer advice on how to craft your document. One thing that is helpful, though, is investigating potential employers and see what *they* value in resumes for candidates.

[This document is from the University of Mary Washington's Human Resources department](https://adminfinance.umw.edu/hr/employment-opportunities/best-practices/screening-applicants/how-to-evaluate-resumes-and-cvs/); it's part of a series of resources they posted internally for their employees as they go through the process of hiring someone. It's pretty fascinating to see what hiring committees look for in resumes - this is great insight into how you might design your resume to increase the chances of it being looked at.

When it does come time to apply to a job, it's worth researching the company to see if you're a good fit for the company (or if the company is a good fit for you). You can always check out [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) for this type of information. And while yo uare in the researching mode, you should always poke around the website of the place your applying and see if you can find information that might inform how you design your resume (like this Mary Washington's document).

Note that not every company publishes a document like this (and many companies might not even have a document like this). But it's a good idea to at least check this one out so you have some idea of what hiring committees are looking at.
