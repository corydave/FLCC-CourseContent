^^ ASSIGNMENT - Long Term FLCC Planning

# Description

You are not required to register for classes right now, but it's better to do it sooner rather than later.

The best reasons why you should register:

* *So you get the classes you want!* Don't forget that if enough people register for a class you want (or need), there might not be room for you. Beat the rush!

* Classes can get cancelled if not enough people enroll in them. Registering for a class shows you are interested and helps prevent cancellations.

* You'll feel good about yourself. You're already getting a leg up on the next semester!
