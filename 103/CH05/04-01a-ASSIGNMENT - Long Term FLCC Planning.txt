^^ ASSIGNMENT - Long Term FLCC Planning

# Description

FLCC's Long-Term Planning is a methodology to help plan your future semesters here at the college. The intention here is to get you thinking clearly about what's left in your academic pursuit here at FLCC!

We have pivoted to a new system this year, so the exact specifications of this assignment will be built around that (in the coming weeks).
