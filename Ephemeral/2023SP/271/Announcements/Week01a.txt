^^ Week #1 - What to Expect

# Welcome!
Welcome, folks! Thank you so much for your patience as I worked out some kinks in Brightspace.

Everything *should* be all set. If you find any errors, please email me at dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu and I'll fix them (as a bonus, you will earn **Bug Bounty** points).

# This week
This week is all about orientation to the course. In Brightspace, you'll find **Chapter 0 - Orientation** and **Chapter 1 - TestOut Orientation**. You'll need to carve out some time to address both of these (I estimate 4ish hours).

# TestOut
If you have not yet obtained your key to TestOut, make sure you do that this week. You can find the link to our particular class in the Course Outline and [also right here](https://labsimapp.testout.com/v6_0_536/index.html/createaccount?inviteid=30be729c-4f77-4e6a-bd1a-334fcba84365).

# `changelog`
I've fixed a few issues already:
* One link to the Course Outline (Syllabus) pointed to the Syllabus of a different class.
* Chapter 0 was briefly visible and then not visible.
* Some assignments in this course were visible but not accessible.

## Let's be careful out there!
