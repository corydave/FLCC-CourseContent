^^ WEEK #1 - What to Expect

# Welcome!
Welcome, folks! Thank you so much for your patience as I worked out some kinks in Brightspace.

Everything *should* be all set. If you find any errors, please email me at dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu and I'll fix them (as a bonus, you will earn **Bug Bounty** points).
