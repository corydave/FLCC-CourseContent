^^ WEEK 4 - Midweek Check In

Hey folks! Thinking of you this weekend and hoping that you are doing well. 

A few notes:

* I hope you are enjoying the sampler. Just a recap: The first video is meant to show you how to embed your projects into Google Sites. The rest of the videos are tutorials for five different projects.

* I anticipate having everything graded by Monday night.

* Keep up the great work!
