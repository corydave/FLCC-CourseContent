^^ THIS IS THE LAST WEEK!

Hey folks! This is the *last week of the semester*!!! Yay! You made it!

# What's going on

There are a few things to keep in mind:
* All work has been graded (except for any final reflection that was submitted early)

* If you see something in the grade book that looks wonky to you, let me know.

* There was an issue with the Twine assignment; between the time I recorded the tutorial and when the assignment rolled around, the interface had changed considerably. This made it difficult to figure out how to get the `.html` file that you needed to submit. I'm super sorry that happened! I have updated the grades as follows:
    * If you managed to figure out how to export the `.html` file, you have received extra credit on top of the 40 points.
    * If you made a good faith attempt at the assignment, you have received full credit.
    * If you submitted nothing, your zero will stand.

* I believe the course surveys are out. Please make sure you fill them out. I don't get to see the results until after grades are due, so they cannot affect your overall grade. I do like to read the results as it helps me improve. Please be honest. One thing I find is that I can improve with actionable feedback but not with vague responses. For instance, "This class was boring" doesn't help me, but "This class was boring because I don't see how Google Sheets is important in a teacher's daily job" is pointed and I can work with that. 

# What to expect after 12/17
Since grading is all caught up in this class, I anticipate looking at the final reflections as soon as possible after they are due (that is noon on December 17). I'll send an announcement out when the final grades are computed in Brightspace.

As a reminder, *no work can be accepted after 12/17 at noon*. 

This is not the last time you'll hear from me this week, but I want to say I enjoyed working with you!!!
