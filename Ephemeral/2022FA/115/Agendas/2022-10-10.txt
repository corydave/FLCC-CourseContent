AGENDA - 2022-10-10
=============

### Information

Today we chatted about *projects* in this class. Projects typically are a bit longer and require more planning. We started by chatting about CoinStar machines - you know, those machines that convert coins to dollars (and take a percentage for their trouble).

We plotted out our plan of attack by looking at this output:

```
How many pennies did you insert?
1013
You have deposited $10.13
The processing fee is: $2.0260000000000002
You earned $8.104000000000001
```

It was important to note that without planning ahead of time we probably would have run into issues (like calculating the overall deposit value and the processing fee without saving them so we could do math on them later).

We also did a bit of pseudocode to work through `CoinStar`:

^= = ,,, 12

1. import a Scanner / instantiate Scanner
2. prompt user for pennies
3. store their answer in `pennies`
4. tell user & STORE how dollars/cents (divide `pennies` by 100 and store as `deposit`)
5. STORE processing fee (`fee`) as `pennies` times 0.20 (20%)
6. subtract `fee` from `deposit`

<center>

`final double PERCENT = .20;`

</center>

^=

On Wednesday we'll be looking at the next two projects (which will require us to know more about the `String` class).
