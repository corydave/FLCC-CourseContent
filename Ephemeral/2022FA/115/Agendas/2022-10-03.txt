### Information

We looked at random numbers (using the `Math.random()` and the `Random` class) today. The [code is in GitHub](https://github.com/corydave/FLCC_CSC_115/blob/main/2022FA/2022-10-03/RandomDemo.java)

One important takeaway! Google Cloud Shell has autocomplete, and that might include methods for classes that are *not* respected by CodeGrade. Specifically,

```java
Random rand = new Random();
rand.nextInt(1, 7);
```

will generate a random number `[1, 6]` in Google Cloud Shell. But that method is *not* recognized in CodeGrade (version issues). Instead, use:

```java
Random rand = new Random();
rand.nextInt(6) + 1;
```
