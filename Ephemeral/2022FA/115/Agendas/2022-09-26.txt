### Information

Today we looked at some wonky casting issues and spent time looking at `Scanner` (also a bit wonky at times).

The Reading Guides for the rest of the class are in a module called *Future Reading Guides*. As the modules start becoming available, I'll move them into the Reading Guides.

Thank you for awesome, engaging participation!
