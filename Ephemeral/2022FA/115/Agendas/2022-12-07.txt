### Information

Lab day today, but we *did* look at two code fragments that will be helpful on the work you are doing:

### `do-while` Loop Example:

<br />

```java ^copy

while (temp != 0) {
    System.out.print("Enter a number, 0 to exit:");
    temp = scanner.nextInt();
}

do {
    System.out.print("Enter a number, 0 to exit:");
    temp = scanner.nextInt();
} while (temp != 0);

```

### Creating an Array of Specified Length:

<br />

```java ^copy

int length = scanner.nextIn();
int[] arr = new int[length];

```

### What's due

* Due dates are up to date in CodeGrade

* The final exam is on 12/12 and is held in class.

* On 12/14 we will be meeting at ***WENDY'S*** in Victor instead of class. I'm buying!
