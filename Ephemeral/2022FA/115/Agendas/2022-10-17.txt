AGENDA - 2022-10-17
=============

^callout info-circle

### Information
Today we looked at `if` statements (as well as `if-else` and `if-else if` statements). The logic here is what helps us make sweet programs. Be sure to [check out the code from GitHub](https://github.com/corydave/FLCC_CSC_115/blob/main/2022FA/2022-10-17/IfDemos.java).

We also looked at cool websites ([Akinator](https://en.akinator.com/game) and [20Q.net](http://20q.net/)) that really get a lot of mileage out of `if` statements.
