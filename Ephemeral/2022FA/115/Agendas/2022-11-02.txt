### Information

Time to check out *methods*! 

Methods are helpful for a few different reasons:

* They prevent **`DRY`** code (*Don't Repeat Yourself*).

* They tuck away code you will reuse in a different part of the program.

* They can take in parameters (arguments) and do stuff with them

There are a few different ways to use methods - be aware of the *return types* in the method signature. Also, don't forget that we *overloadded* methods by making some methods with the same name (but different parameter lists)
