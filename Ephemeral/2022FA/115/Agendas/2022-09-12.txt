### The Reading Guide was missing from Brightspace navigation
I'm super sorry - I did not make it easy to find the Reading Guide for Chapter 2. I've extended the due date for that until Monday 9/19 - Please make sure you get it done by then.

### Information

We will be covering chapter 2 today
* Primitive data types (`int`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`)
* We'll also look a little bit at `String` (which is a class, not a primitive data type

We will also be exploring at really wonky behavior with output and variable types. Check out the notes at GitHub: [`BlowYerMind.java`](https://github.com/corydave/FLCC_CSC_115/tree/main/2022FA/2022-09-12)
