^^ FINAL MESSAGE ðŸ˜¥

## THANK YOU

Whelp folks, it's been a GREAT semester. Thank you so much for your final projects!! I hope you've been able to take away a lot this semester. Or one thing. Maybe just one thing. If you've taken away one thing, that's a win!

I was a bit nervous before this semester started (using new tools like Brightspace), and I know there were a few hiccups, but I appreciate your tenacity.

Thank you for being awesome and making this semester GREAT! If you find you ever need something, please let me know.

## GRADES

Your final grades are posted. Please go through and verify that they look right to you. This message is being posted on 12/19, and I will be submitting grades on the evening of 12/24. If you observe any issues, *please* get them to me before I submit the grades! Once I submit them, I cannot change them.

## SURVEYS
