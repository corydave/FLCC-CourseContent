^^ THIS IS THE LAST WEEK!

Hey folks! This is the *last week of the semester*!!! Yay! You made it!

# What's going on

There are a few things to keep in mind:

* Since you need to submit planning documents with your final project, I've opened up a place to do that in Brightspace (right under the description). You can submit a file. If you have a link to submit instead, you'll have to put it in a file and submit the file because Brightspace doesn't let me create an assignment that accepts links *or* files; it has to be one or the other. Blergh.

* If you see something in the grade book that looks wonky to you, let me know.

I anticipate having all items graded before Friday. I'll send an announcement out when I'm done so that you can make sure everything looks good.

* I believe the course surveys are out. Please make sure you fill them out. I don't get to see the results until after grades are due, so they cannot affect your overall grade. I do like to read the results as it helps me improve. Please be honest. One thing I find is that I can improve with actionable feedback but not with vague responses. For instance, "This class was boring" doesn't help me, but "This class was boring because <provide a reason>" is pointed and I can work with that. 

# What to expect after 12/17
I anticipate looking at the final projects as soon as possible after they are due (that is noon on December 17). I'll send an announcement out when the final grades are computed in Brightspace.

As a reminder, *no work can be accepted after 12/17 at noon*. 

This is not the last time you'll hear from me this week, but I want to say I enjoyed working with you!!!
