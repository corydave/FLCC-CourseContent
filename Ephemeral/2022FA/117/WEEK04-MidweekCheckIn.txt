^^ WEEK 4 - Midweek Check In

Hey folks! Thinking of you this weekend and hoping that you are doing well. 

A few notes:

* I know I was a little late getting all the labs up and running in CodeGrade. If you need more time than the two week grace period, please let me know!

* There was an error in CodeGrade (my fault!) on the `boundedRandomNumber` lab. I've fixed it. I believe it only affected two students. I'm super sorry about that and I'll be even more diligent in the future.

* I sincerely hope you are enjoying Python!

* I anticipate having everything graded by Monday night.
