^^ WEEK 4 - Midweek Check In

Hey folks! Thinking of you this weekend and hoping that you are doing well. 

A few notes:

* This is the first chapter that spans two weeks. I've been looking at the work so far and it seems like many of you are able to understand the wonkiness of this chapter. I hope you enjoy the second week as well.

* The Messy Problem is assigned to each student individually. Make sure you check that out in the assignment!

* I anticipate having everything graded by Monday night.
