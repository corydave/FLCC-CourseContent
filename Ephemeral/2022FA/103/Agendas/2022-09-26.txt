### Open Source

Open source is great! In the domain of computer science, we say software is open source if it means that the code is freely available for others to use, modify, and (in some cases) distribute. Open source projects include:

* Linux (an operating system)
* GIMP (similar to Photoshop)
* Libre Office (similar to Microsoft Office)

* We chatted about ATMs and shopping carts (see below)
