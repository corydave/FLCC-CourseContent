### Cool Story

We chatted a bit about the [recent episode of Darknet Diaries (#125)](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/125/) about a penetration tester and his awesome infiltration.

We also talked about the recent [Akamai CDN bug](https://medium.com/@jacopotediosi/worldwide-server-side-cache-poisoning-on-all-akamai-edge-nodes-50k-bounty-earned-f97d80f3922b) which led to conversation about bug bounties.
