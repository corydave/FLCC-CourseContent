### Study Tip
We talked about goal setting and SMART goals. Michael suggested that breaking tasks down into digestible bits helps (like patching a hole in a wall). We also talked about SMART goalsetting:

* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Relevant
* Time-Bound

Check out the [University of California's bit on SMART goalsetting](https://www.ucop.edu/local-human-resources/_files/performance-appraisal/How%20to%20write%20SMART%20Goals%20v2.pdf).

### Information

We also chatted about *messy problems* (also known as *wicked problems*). We considered the domain of traffic as an example and looked at [a video of different intersections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yITr127KZtQ).

Then we did some light problem solving when it came to the **Messy Problems**  assignment. Be sure to [check out the problems here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BGsUEwH9AbzpFRObM2IqjayRXBmf5RPwe2ZTB31RO08/edit#). As a class, we are tackling problems 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 20, and 22.
