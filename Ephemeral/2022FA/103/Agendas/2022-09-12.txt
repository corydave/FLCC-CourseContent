### NO CLASS ON WEDNESDAY, 9/14

There is no class on Wednesday, 9/14!!!! Instead, plan on working on the work that is due (the Infographic - if you are still working on it - and the Technical Writing Set) I'll be available via Discord and email (dave.ghidiu@flcc.edu).

### Information

Today we will be looking at *Technical Writing*. There are many different venues when you might find yourself tasked with some technical writing (support manuals as PC support technician, briefs/summaries for your boss, comments in code, etc.)

We'll watch a video (making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches) as well as look at some tips from authoritative sources for technical writing.

We'll also talk about LEGO instructions.

### Technical Writing Tips

I suggest keeping the following in mind:

1. Use a lot of *white space* - that means don't scrunch your words together. Use generous line spaces to separate the steps.

2. BE CONCISE! Eliminate *any* extra words.

3. Format your writing. Use headers and styles to generate flow for the reader. Zoomed out, it should be very clear how many steps there are and the order of the steps.

4. Write as an expert. Don't use language to justify your writing or the notion that there is a better way.

5. Use images or illustrations if you can!
