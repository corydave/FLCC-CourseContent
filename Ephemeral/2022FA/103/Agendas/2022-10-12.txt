### Section 203
One thing of note that we talked about today was "[Section 203](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230)" which protects platforms (such as Facebook and Glassdoor) from content that users post.

### Information

We looked at some websites like [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) and [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) that are useful when looking at jobs. Then we looked at personality tests (despite the lack of science behind some of them). I got an **INFJ** today.
