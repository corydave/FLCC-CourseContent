### Information

Today we had a really neat conversation about Ethics. Turns out there is *a lot* of gray area when looking at ethical issues. 

[Catch the slideshow here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U_dAft581JVb_Q-1TWwenArcoR5VP14dsz1K7IMX-w4/edit) or [watch the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwwezlaHZJw).

We didn't quite get through the presentation, but we'll pick up on it in the next class.
