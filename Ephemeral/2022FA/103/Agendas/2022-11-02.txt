### Information

Today we looked at *making sweet, sweet games* using [Twine](https://twinery.org/). Our job today was to explore some cool retro-games that use choices as the game mechanic. Zork, Oregon Trail, or any game made with Twine. 

We also played [Spent](https://playspent.org/) as an example of a visceral, text-based game.
