### Laker Day!!!
Tuesday is **Laker Day**!!!! That means there are no classes - just a bunch of cool activities. You can [see the list here](https://flcc.edu/lakerday/). 

Last year the Computing Sciences department had a waffle bar. This year we will have a Soft Pretzel bar (12:00-1:30 in the cafeteria).
